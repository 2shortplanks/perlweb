with whispers of others in the works.</p>

<p>The YAPC::NA Conference Committee is planning to choose the 2004

enough to insure that all interested parties have enough time to
finalize submissions.</p>

e-mail to <a href="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>.

<h2>July 10, 2003<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2003/yapcna2004cfv.html">YAPC::NA::2004 Call For Venues</a></h2>
<p>With YAPC::NA::2003 over, it's time to get ready for YAPC::NA::2004,
and that means it's time to throw open the call for venues for next
year's YAPC.</p>

<p>You can get details on what YAPCs entail in both YAPC.pm, on CPAN, and
at <a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>.
When making your proposal, in addition to venue information and
dates, do please make sure to include details on airport locations,
local public transit (as well as transit to the venue from the
airport!), local cultural attractions, and accommodation information.
(See the docs for more details) The more information you provide,
within reason, the better.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to 
<a href="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>.
Proposals are due by Friday, August 1st 2003, with a decision due two
weeks later on August 15th 2003. (If the summertime vacation blahs
catch everyone out we may extend the deadline. Don't count on that)
This gives about 7 weeks, which is short but manageable, and should
still fit within most college and university scheduling requirements.</p>
