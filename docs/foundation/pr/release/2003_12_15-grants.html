<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the recipients of the
latest round of grants aimed at furthering Perl development. Damian
Conway to complete Perl6::Rules and Mark Jason Dominus for a
replacement debugger and lexical pragmas.</p>

<p>Damian Conway will receive $12,000 to complete the Perl6::Rules
module implementing as much of the rule syntax and semantics described
in Apocalypse 5 and 6. This would be a working implementation of the
Perl 6 rules in Perl 5, allowing a clearer and forward-compatible
interface for regexes usable by Perl 5 users.</p>

<p>A major part of this work includes creating an integrated debugger
and improving diagnostics support. This involves adding diagnostics to
the rule parser in such a way that the tests do not impact on
performance, except when an error occurs. The rudimentary debugger
would also be extended and integrated into the prototype.</p>

<p>This grant also includes the completion a comprehensive test suite
for Perl6::Rules, extending the number of tests from 400 to at least
2000. A more extensive test suite means a more robust module and would
be directly helpful in the development of the actual Perl 6
interpreter. This work would also include fixing any bugs in
Perl6::Rules detected by these additional tests.</p>

<p>Mark Jason Dominus will receive $3,500 to work on a replacement for
Perl's debugger. Perl's debugger is currently 2600 lines of magic and
special cases. The code is nearly unreadable, fixing bugs and adding
new features is fraught with difficulties. The debugger has no test
suite which has caused breakage with changes that couldn't be properly
tested. It will also not debug regexes. This grant is aimed at fixing
these problems and delivering a replacement debugger.</p>

<p>One of the core deliverables is a reusable library of essential
debugger functions which debugger applications could be written on top
of. This will have plug-in support to enable sub-debuggers to take
control over certain parts of the debugging process; the regex
debugger would be one plug-in. A test suite for the library and
standard debugger application will also be delivered as well as
complete documentation.</p>

<p>Mark Jason Dominus will also receive $750 to complete his work on
lexically scoped pragmas. Several Perl pragma declarations should be
lexically scoped but aren't. One example is the "sort" pragma. The
affect is global to the program that it appears in. This decreases the
usefulness of this declaration because you cannot safely use this
declaration in a module as it will affect every sort in every program
that uses the module.</p>

<p>In September 2003, Mark Jason Dominus submitted a trial patch to
enable the use of lexical pragmas. This grant will allow this work to
be finished and issues related to the change including the behavior of
pragmas over "eval" and file boundaries; the completion of the test
suite and documentation; garbage collection of pragma data; and the
conversion of sort.pm, strict.pm, and B::Deparse.</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl
programming language through open discussion, collaboration, design,
and code. The Perl Foundation is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization 
based in Holland, Michigan.</p>
