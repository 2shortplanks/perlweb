<ul>
<li>18GB SCSI drives

<li>16+ port console server, preferably one we can ssh to.

<!-- <li>Bizrate got us a <a href="http://xrl.us/bmii">gigabit switch</a>
for our internal net, but eventually it'll be full and we'll need more
ports. -->

</ul>

If you have some other useful spare hardware or can help in another
way, email webmaster at perl.org and we'll see if we can make use of
it.
