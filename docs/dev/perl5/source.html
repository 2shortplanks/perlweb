[% page.title = "Getting and Working With the Perl Source" %]


<p>
The Perl source code is currently kept in a <a
href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> repository.  Generally,
only the developers with <b>write</b> access to the repository access
it via the Perforce tools.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get a copy of the latest Perl source code, the easiest
way to do this is to use <i>rsync</i>:</p>

<pre>
rsync -avz rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current/ .
</pre>

<p>
If you want to get the maintenance branch of perl (currently 5.8.x) instead
of the development branch, the appropriate <i>rsync</i> URL is:</p>

<pre>
rsync -avz rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-5.8.x/ .
</pre>

<p>
This takes care of updating every single item in the source tree to
the latest applied patch level, creating files that are new (to your
distribution) and setting date/time stamps of existing files to
reflect the bleadperl status.
</p>

<p>
Note that this will not delete any files that were in '.' before
the rsync. Once you are sure that the rsync is running correctly,
run it with the --delete and the --dry-run options like this:
</p>

<pre>
rsync -avz --delete --dry-run rsync://public.activestate.com/perl-current/ .
</pre>

<p>
This will <i>simulate</i> an rsync run that also deletes files not
present in the bleadperl master copy. Observe the results from
this run closely. If you are sure that the actual run would delete
no files precious to you, you could remove the --dry-run option.
</p>

<p>
You can than check what patch was the latest that was applied by
looking in the file <b>.patch</b>, which will show the number of the
latest patch.
</p>

<p>
If you'd simply like to browse changes online, you can use the <a
href="http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse">Perl Repository Browser</a>.
</p>

<p>
You may also find the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Repository-APC/">Perl::Repository::APC</a>
module, and the scripts it comes with, helpful when working on the Perl source code.
</a>

<p>
Chia-liang Kao has developed a distributed version control system
called <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">SVK</a>, which allows one to
mirror remote repositories locally and then work with them using
standard version control procedures.  Currently, it only supports
remote Subversion repositories, but work is being done to include
support for others, including Perforce.  By the time you read this,
that support may be implemented.  This will provide yet another way of
working with the Perl source code.
