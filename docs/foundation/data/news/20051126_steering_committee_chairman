Title: Richard Dice elected Perl Foundation steering committee chair

<p>
Richard Dice has been elected to chair the Perl Foundation Steering
Committee.  Richard fills the vacancy left by Bill Odom when he
became TPF President.  The election was between Jim Brandt and Richard,
who have both done great work for the community, most notably organizing
YAPC::NA 2004 in Buffalo and YAPC::NA 2005 in Toronto, respectively.

<p>
Richard has clear ideas for where TPF should be headed.  Richard's draft
of a TPF mission statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
TPF exists to promote Perl to people and organizations so that they
can benefit from all of what is available within the Perl community.
</p>
<p>
Because we want to help.
</p>

<p>
If we are successful then the result will be the growth of the Perl
language and community -- a positive feedback loop to the benefit
of all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Richard sees this as fitting into four specific areas of activity:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Introduce Perl, and foster its use, to IT professionals and
amateurs of all stripes (programmers, sysadmins, students, scientists, engineers and more)

<li> Work to create a space within the IT and business world
that is amenable to the use of Perl

<li> Provide support to people working on key technological
(and sometimes cultural) pieces of Perl

<li> Lead the Perl culture -- by providing a good example
</ol>
