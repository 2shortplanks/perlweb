<h2>July 27, 2001<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2001/yasmerges.html">YAS, Perl Monks, Perl Mongers to Merge</a></h2>
<p>Today at the Open Source Software Convention Kevin Lenzo announced a
new foundation is being created between these Perl communities. Coming
together gives a clear place for support and development of Perl. Not
only does this have the blessing of the Perl elders (Larry has agreed
to be on the board) but there is corporate interest from the community
which recognizes the importance of Perl and free software. YAS will
continue the effort for Perl development grants as it has in the past.
We will be setting up a vehicle to accept funding, but we still need
your active volunteer participation as well. All the details are still
being worked on, and you can watch this site for more information as
it becomes available.</p>
