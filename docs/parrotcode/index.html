<h2> Parrot 0.4.1 "Foghorn Leghorn" Released! </h2>

<p>
On January 8th, 2006, Parrot pumpking Leo T&ouml;tsch released Parrot 0.4.1
See the <a href="news/2006/Parrot-0.4.1.html">Parrot
0.4.1 release announcement</a> for more details or <a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/L/LT/LTOETSCH/parrot-0.4.1.tar.gz">download
Parrot 0.4.1</a> from the CPAN. 
</p>

<h2> What is Parrot </h2>

<p> Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute
bytecode for interpreted languages. Parrot will be the target for the final
Perl 6 compiler, and is already usable as a backend for
<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a>, as well as variety of 
<a href="/languages/">other languages</a>.
</p>

<h2>Under Development</h2>

<p>To keep up to date on current developments, check out <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/">This week on Perl 6</a> by
Matt Fowles and Piers Cawley which covers the Parrot and Perl 6 mailing lists. 
Piers's summaries will appear on
<a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/xml/atom10/category/perl-6-summaries/feed.xml">
this RSS feed</a> first.</p>

<!--
<p>
We're approaching our 11,000th commit, and
we're happy to report that as of late, the rate of parrot development has
been increasing. Here's a short summary of what's going on now:
</p> 
-->
<!--
<p>
Design-wise, Chip Salzenberg is working on calling conventions with respect
to exception
handlers, while Matt Diephouse tackles namespaces, Joshua Hoblitt considers a
rewrite of the configure system, and Jonathan Worthington is both designing
and implementing high-level language debug segments and packfile PMCs.
Leopold T&ouml;tsch has
the lexical specification
(<a href="/docs/pdd/pdd20_lexical_vars.html">PDD20</a>)
in his implementation queue, and has been
improving parrot's Unicode support.
</p><p>
The Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE) is in a state of constant improvement, keeping
Patrick Michaud out of trouble. Allison Randal is continuing
her implementation of Perl 1, a.k.a. 'Punie.'
</p><p>
Bernhard Schmalhofer has been revising the stale examples in the repository,
updating them to
provide a good starting point for learning parrot, and adding tests to make
sure they are updated as parrot grows and changes. Jerry Gay has been adding
tests to PGE, and has been trying to stay ahead of Patrick (so far, Patrick
has been much too fast to catch.)
</p>

<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>

<p>
    Parrot development takes place on the perl6-internals mailing list.
    If you follow this list, you'll be able to get an idea
    of what sort of things are needed.

    Subscribe by sending mail to <a
    href="mailto:perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org">perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org</a>
    or read the <a
    href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals">perl6-internals NNTP
    archive</a>.  </p>

<p> There is documentation in the <code>docs</code> subdirectory of the Parrot
source, with an snapshot here of <a href="docs/">svn-latest
documentation</a>.</p>

<p> There is a <a href="todo.html">list of TODO items</a>.</p>

<p> Patches of all natures are welcome. See the <a href="patchfaq.html">patch
FAQ</a> for details.  </p>

<p> View and manipulate bugs and TODO items at the <a
