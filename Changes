1.3 - at some unknown point in the future

  - IMPORTANT: The default search path for templates is now
    "docs/$site", rather than "docs/live/$site".  The live thing was
    to make development on branches easier, but it turned out setting up a
    whole development httpd from a branch is so easy that we never
    used that feature.
    * Either move your templates from docs/live/$site to docs/$site, or
      set docs_name in combust.conf to docs/live.
 
  - more tweaks of the POD module
  - set apache_reload in the configuration to > 1 to enable
    Apache::Reload debugging
  - new configuration directive: proxyip_allowed for multiple front
     end proxy servers.
  - Change database configuration to allow more than one data_source,
    see the new combust.conf.sample for the new syntax.

1.2 - June 18, 2004
  - Lots of changes to make it easier to create a non-perl.org site with combust
    - better "default site" (with instructions on how to fix it!)
    - UseDocuementRoot override (for the default site)
    - add some empty default templates to "root_templates" so we don't have
      to copy the wrapper around (and explain how to)
    - add default error pages (pain to copy around too!)
  - memcached support in Combust::Cache - http://www.danga.com/memcached/
  - even easier cookie usage from Combust::Control sub-classes
  - block requests for /tpl/ directories
  - various bugfixes
