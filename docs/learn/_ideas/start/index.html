 I wanna learn some perl, but when i seeking out for tutorials on the web, none of them stated what should I write perl with. I know that it need a text editor, but that's not clear enough. So is notepad a text editor? if is, what's the extension of the file when i need to save it? If i wrote a perl program, where should i put it? Inside the html code? upload to website? or run it on my own PC? And should a perl program be alone or have to stick to some html code?
: This are my confusions. I appreciate any help i can get.
: Thanx everyone!
