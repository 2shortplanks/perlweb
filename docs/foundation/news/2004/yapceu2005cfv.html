<p>European YAPC's and National Workshops now have a foundation.</p>

<p>The main goal of the newly formed YAPC Europe Foundation is to provide
assistance on request to any European crew setting up a conference (be
it a YAPC::Europe or a national workshop).</p>

<p>The foundation can bring help in terms of experience from previous
organisers, resources: web space, CVS, mailing lists... (online
payment will also be offered), etc.</p>

<p>Of course, its chief concern is to make sure there is a yearly
YAPC::Europe, and while the Belfast Perl mongers are organizing the
YAPC::Europe::2004 conference in Northern Ireland with enthusiasm, YEF
is already looking for next years candidates.</p>

<p>Any dedicated crew interested in organizing the YAPC::Europe
conference in 2005 should send an informal application, stating their
interest, to:</p>

<p>"YAPC::Europe conference proposal" committee@yapceurope.org</p>

<p>Questions about the application and help to present it can also be
asked at this same address.</p>

<p>Deadline for applications: August 15th 2004</p>

<p>For general information about the venue requirements, check the
YAPC::Venue module on CPAN, and look at the previous venues at:</p>
