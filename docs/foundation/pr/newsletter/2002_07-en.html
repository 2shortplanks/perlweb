<h3>The Perl Foundation Grants</h3>
<p>
Thanks go out to the Perl Community for making TPF grants so
successful over the past two years! We've raised over $190,000 since
2000, mainly through the generous contributions of individuals
throughout our community. Donors are highlighted on the <a
href="http://donate.perlfoundation.org/index.pl?node=Fund%20Drive%20Status"
class="aLink">TPF Fund Status Page</a>
</p>
<p>
We'd also like to thank those people who have been very supportive
with matching donations. Matching challenges have been a successful
fund raising tool for several Perl Monger groups, and others, during
the year. Both individuals and companies have issued successful
matching challenges. Of note, 
<a href="http://www.stonehenge.com/">Stonehenge Consulting</a> matched
donations of several Perl Monger groups and David Hand generously
matched $1500 raised by NY.pm. 
</p>
<p>
We've seen a lot of 
<a href="/gc/grants/2002.html">great work from TPF grant recipients</a>
this year.
<a href="/gc/grants/2002_damian.html">Damian Conway reports</a> that
during the course of his grants, he produced 55 releases of 21
distinct modules, wrote several articles, including the 
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis">Exegeses</a>, and made 56
presentations at conferences and Perl user groups. All this in
addition to participating heavily in perl news groups, perlmonks.com,
and other online venues. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="/gc/grants/2002_dan.html">Dan Sugalski</a> has been hard at
work speaking with user groups, writing articles, and hacking 
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>. The interpreter is
now functional and working, along with garbage collection, IO, dynamic
code loading, and global variables. 

</p>
<p>
<a href="/gc/grants/2002_larry.html">Larry Wall</a> continued working
on Perl 6 language design as explained in his 
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">Apocalypse
documents</a>. More details on activities funded through TPF grants
are available on the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">Perl
Foundation web site</a>. 
</p>
<p>
	Thanks to Larry, Damian, and Dan for all their hard work!.

<h3>Over 300 Gather at YAPC '02 </h3>
<p>
Over 300 Perl enthusiasts gathered in St. Louis for the 4th Annual
YAPC. Thanks to all, particularly the St. Louis team, who made this a
great event! Images and audio interviews are available at: 
<a href="http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/">http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/</a> 
</p>
<p>
As in past years, Lightning Talks were a popular event. Adam Turoff
and Allison Randal spoke on Perl 6, Andy Lester asked for more
civility among the community, and Tim Maher had everyone singing 'The
Name Game'. 
</p>
<p>
Nat Torkington debuted his hilarious movie about a young Python
programmer among perl folks. View it online at 
<a href="http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/movies">http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/movies.</a>
This movie has been rated R for mature language and mild sexual
content. It is a Nathan Torkington production, after all. 
<p>

<h3>Funds Raised at YAPC </h3>
<p>
At YAPC, The Perl Foundation President Kevin Lenzo kicked off the
Foundation's latest fund drive by raising $4000 with an auction of
books and other merchandise. Thanks to the publishers, including 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly</a>, 
<a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning</a> and 
<a href="http://www.awl.com/">Addison-Wesley</a>, for their book
donations! 
</p>
<p>
The people at YAPC bid enthusiastically and when the auction total
came $276 short of an even $4000, Tim Maher generously brought the
total up. Hot auction items included Sean Burke's new Perl &amp; LWP
book, and two 'Stitch' plush dolls brought straight from Disney by
Robert Spier. 
</p>

<h3>TPF at OSCON 2002</h3>
<p>
Thanks to everyone for sharing your thoughts and comments both at the
TPF booth and at the TPF BOF.
</p>
<p>
During a special auction at OSCON, TPF raised $1120 through the sale
of five signed london.pm shirts, three Disney Stitch dolls, and
several Quake III Arena games. Thanks to Robert Spier and Casey West
for organizing the event! 
</p>

<h3>YAPC 2003</h3>
<p>
It's time to put together your proposal to host next year's YAPC.
