In rough order of priority
==========================

Move urls to /about/ instead of /about.html

Map old urls to new

Add the include_root to the Etag

Make the siteinfo page look nicer.  =^) Make sponsor list a
"friends of perl.org" thing.

Set default style in the httpd.conf or in a combust.conf file.

Make the controller set the INCLUDE_PATH depending on the vhost (or document root?)
  - maybe use a separate configuration file so it's easy to specify
    pulling from svn or from a directory
    - possibly configured per branch?

Make the default.html style non-perl.org specific; use perl.html style
(maybe in turn calling default.html?) for the perl.org sites.



Cache full html outputs?  Use master svn revision in the cache key. Or
maybe use svn revision for perl.org/backend/ combined with svn
revision for perl.org/docs/[site]/.

We really don't want to use xhtml?  :-)  Maybe in a year or two I guess.

Lowercase all the html?

Handle If-Modified-Since requests.

Format POD as html when foo.html is requested and doesn't exist, but
foo.pod does.  Format POD as html when foo.pod.html is requested too.



Cache data from the svn server; refresh when svn version goes up.
Cache .tar.gz files on disk or in mysql?


Get content type from svn?  In any case: Handle .tar.gz files etc in
some way.
