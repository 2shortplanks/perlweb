<h2>July 20, 2004 YAPC::NA::2005 Call For Venues</h2>

It's time to throw open the call for venues for next
year's <a HREF="http://yapc.org/">YAPC::NA</a>.
<p>

You can get details on what YAPCs entail
at <a HREF="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.
<p>
This year we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a HREF="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a> for more information on this.
<p>
Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are due by
Friday, August 31 2004, with a decision due on September
15 2004. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks,
which is short but manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.
<p>
You can watch the <a HREF="http://yapc.org/">YAPC.org</a> home page for any
more info or changes."</i>
