<p>Just a friendly reminder that the August 1st Call for Venue deadline
is almost upon us. At this point only one proposal has materialized,
with whispers of others in the works.</p>

<p>The YAPC::NA Conference Committee is planning to choose the 2004
venue, in roughly two weeks (August 15th).  This date will be flexible
enough to insure that all interested parties have enough time to
finalize submissions.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or need feedback on your proposal, send
e-mail to <a href="mailto:yapc-venues@yetanother.org">yapc-venues@yetanother.org</a>.
Good Luck!</p>
