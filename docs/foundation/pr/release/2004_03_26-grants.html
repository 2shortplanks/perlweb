<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the latest grant aimed at
furthering development in Perl, Simon Cozens will receive $1000 to
enhance Maypole.</p>

<p>Maypole is a new Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for web
applications, similar to Java's Struts, but designed for minimal
coding and maximal flexibility. Many Perl programmers would save many
hours when faced with developing ye t another web front-end to a
database without requiring much code. A Perl equivalent of the popular
Struts framework w ould fit the needs of more heavy-duty users. This
grant will involve work with existing Maypole users to determine and
meet their needs; to develop view and template classes for HTML::Mason
and DBIx::SearchBuilder; completion of the May pole manual, and
development of example sites.</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl
programming language through open discussion, colla boration, design,
and code. The Perl Foundation is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization 
based in Holland, Michigan.</p>
