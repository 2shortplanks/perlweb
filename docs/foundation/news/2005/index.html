<p><a href="http://www.nlnet.nl">NLnet</a>, a non-profit organization
supporting open source network technology research and development,

completing the first two Parrot development milestones from the Perl
Foundation's <a href="/gc/grants/2005-p6-proposal.html">funding
proposal</a>: API specification and stub implementation for 9 critical
subsystems. (They will each receive $5k at the start of a milestone,
