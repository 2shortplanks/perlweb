<P>
The signal-handling mechanism in Perl 5 is not safe, but should be. The two
main candidates for implementation are delayed delivery via checkpointing
and the event loop.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>
Signals may leave Perl in an inconsistent state, so that an inocuous
<CODE>print</CODE> in a signal handler might trigger a core-dump. This is referred to as
``unsafe signals''.

<P>
Signal safety is crucial. Signals are how timeouts, child process deaths,
and many other important things are conveyed to a program. Many programs
with operating-system interaction require signals, and core-dumps are
unacceptable.

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="IMPLEMENTATION">IMPLEMENTATION</A></H1>
<P>
There are two choices for implementation: checkpointing, and event loop.
[Editor's note: the other RFC I refer to is fictitious]

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Checkpointing">Checkpointing</A></H2>
<P>
If the Perl interpreter checkpointed itself at internally consistent
states, those states could be used to deliver signals. This would delay
delivery, however, and the semantics of delayed signals might make some
programs impossible to write correctly.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Event_loop">Event loop</A></H2>
<P>
RFC 6 describes a desired event loop mechanism. If the existing signal
mechanism (%SIG) were dropped, signals could simply become events that a
program might or might not respond to. This would be a new model of signal
handling which would make it difficult to reuse algorithms and code for
systems programming from C.
