I'm pleased to announce that I've finally polished off and committed the
data driven news automation for perlfoundation.org.  From here on out,
please do not edit anything in the /news directory, as all the files are
generated from the foundation/data/generate-news script.

I've fully documented the script with Pod::Usage so to get detailed 
information on the generate-news script use the -H flag

    generate-news -H

Here is the news updating process documented within...

ADDING NEWS ITEMS
    Here is a quick summary of how to add a news item.

    1.  cd to docs/live/foundation/data

    2.  edit news/yyyymmdd-match_the_title_but_in_a_safe_filename_way

            vim news/20050704-happy_forth_of_july_from_tpf

    3.  Follow the above format for a data file. (Date:, Short:, and Title:
        headers, a space, then the content of the news item with an optional
        '---' to break up long entries so they'll fit nicely on the
        homepage.

            Date: 20050704
            Short: happyforth
            Title: Happy Forth of July from TPF

            <p>This is a short sample of a body.  Blah, Blah Blah...</p>
            ---
            <p> This is an extended body that will not show up on the homepage or 
            yearly archive pages, but a Read more... link will be provided to view them</p>

    4.  Run generate-news (-v for verbose and/or -f to force all template
        regeneration)

    5.  cd to the foundation directory

    6.  svn status to see what changed

    7.  Verify the results with your web browser

    8.  svn add and commit new and modified files
