<H1>Subversion Access Policy</H1>

<ul>
  <li>Access will be provided to established perl projects that ask nicely.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.</li>
  <li>Resources are limited.  Users who use too much bandwidth and/or CPU will be asked to move elsewhere.  (What's too much?)</li>
  <li>If you have special needs, <i>ask</i>.  The worst we do is say no.</li>
</ul>

<H2>Other Things</H2>

<ul>
  <li>There is no SLA.  We will make our best effort to maintain high
  availability and reliability.</li>
  <li>Abusers may be blocked without any notice.</li>
</ul>
