<h3>Ponie</h3>
<p>The Perl Foundation is pleased to announce the formation of the Ponie
Project, a bridge between Perl 5 and Perl 6. The Perl 5 interpreter
will be rewritten to run on Parrot, the Perl 6 virtual machine. This
will ensure the future of the millions of lines of Perl 5
code at thousands of companies around the world.</p>

<p>Fotango's two-year commitment will allow Arthur Bergman, a Senior
Developer at the company and the main contributor to the Perl 5.8
threading effort, to help TPF coordinate and steer the Ponie project
externally with the Perl community and internally within Fotango. <a
