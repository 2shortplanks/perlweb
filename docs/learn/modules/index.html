<h4>What is a module?</h4>

<p>
    A Perl <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmod.html">module</a> 
    is a set of related functions in a library file, i.e., a
    Perl package with the same name as the file.  It is specifically
    designed to be reusable by other modules or programs. 
    <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> has [% perl_modules | comma %] 
    modules ready for you to use in just this way.
</p>

<p> 
    Most Perl modules are written in Perl, some use <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs.html">XS</a> (they are written in <a href=
    "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>) so require a
    C <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> (if you followed
    the <a href="/installing/">installing</a> instructions you already
    have one). Modules may have dependencies on other modules
    (almost always on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>) and cannot be
    installed without them (or without a specific version of them). Many modules on
    CPAN now require a recent version of Perl (version 5.8 or above).

<h4>How do I install a module?</h4>

<h4>What do I do if it doesn't install?</h4>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/">https://rt.cpan.org/Public/</a> - Has anyone reported the same issue?</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.cpantesters.org/">http://www.cpantesters.org/</a> - Are the tests failing on other peoples systems?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Which module should I use?</h4>

<p>
    Have a look at
    <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Task-Kensho/">Task::Kensho</a>,
    modules are added to this listed based on discussions with various 
    subject matter experts in the Perl Community, so it is a good 
    place to start.
</p>

<h4>Can I create my own package/module?</h4>
<p>
    Yes! - anything other than a very simple
    scripts are often better to write as a module, so that it
    can be tested and reused.
