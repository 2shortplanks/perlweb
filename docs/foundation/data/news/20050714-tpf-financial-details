Title: Allison on TPF Financial Details

<p><i>Why can't we see where our donation money goes? We see appeals 
for money, and donations going into a bottomless pit, and the 
occasional "$4,000 to X, $50,000 to Y" go past. But where's the annual 
report with the actual details of what was earned and what was spent 
and where, and how much you have in the bank at the end of each year?</i></p>
---
<p>You can find TPF's 
<a href="https://donate.perlfoundation.org/index.pl?node=IRS&amp;type=document" rel="nofollow">tax returns</a> 
online (not 2004 yet, because it hasn't been received, stamped and sent 
back yet). Not the friendliest presentation, but it's all there. (Though, 
I notice the online version of the 2003 990 is missing an attached 
statement for grants that didn't fit on the main page. I'll look into that.)</p>

<p>Also, until recently anyone could see the same information in lots of pretty
charts and graphs on <a href="http://guidestar.org/" rel="nofollow">GuideStar.org</a>. 
The information is still there, but they changed their policy so you have to 
register for a free account to see anything, and you have to pay for an account to 
see anything very useful.</p>

<p>So, we're looking for another way to do the friendly display. It looks like 
it's going to boil down to getting someone to write the code. None of our current 
volunteers have the time, but I expect it will be a pretty straightforward job, 
especially for someone who already writes Perl code for a financial company. Maybe 
a couple of weekends, and some light maintenance down the road. Any takers? The 
data is up in the tax returns now, so feel free to play with it and show us a 
sample site.<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
