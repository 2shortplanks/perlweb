    <em>Why code what you can declare? Moose gives you clear object syntax with lots of power when you need it.</em>
</p>

<p>
Perl has had OO capabilities for fifteen years now, but that doesn't mean you have to write your classes like you did back then. With Moose, gone are the days of writing your own constructor, destructor, and accessors. Moose gives you a simple, declarative syntax for specifying your classes. Most of your attribute validation code simply disappears: Moose handles it all for you, given you tell it what kind of data your attributes should contain. Roles allow for easy reuse of behavior independent of class data. It's built to be as flexible as Perl, so if it doesn't do what you want, you can change what you don't like—see the growing MooseX namespace on CPAN. One example of a MooseX module is MooseX::NonMoose, designed to make migrating existing codebases easier. And best of all, the user interface to Moose is Just Perl™, so your developers don't need to learn any arcane syntax.
</p><p>
Attributes in Moose are simple and straightforward. A programmer declares them with a simple function call, using named parameters like many other Perl libraries. This declaration can specify whether the attribute is writable, what kind of values it accepts, a default for the attribute, custom builder / clearer methods, and more. Given type information for an attribute, Moose will optionally try to convert values to that type or throw an exception if it cannot do so. This checking allows the programmer to focus on writing their logic, without getting bogged down in the boring details of value checking.
</p><p>
Just as attributes change how Moose class data is handled, roles change how class behavior is written. Roles are reusable collections of methods that can be added to a class or an object at runtime. With roles, one can write behavior for a collection of classes without needing to know or care about the data those classes manage. Roles can require methods to exist in the classes that use them, and in this way can function like interfaces in more traditional object-oriented languages like Java and C#. As with attributes, exceptions will be thrown upon the failure to satisfy these criteria, providing a structured mechanism for adding behavior to classes.

Well-steeped in the open development model of other Perl projects, Moose has a growing number of committers with a growing number of tests—over four thousand as of this writing. Anyone with a secure shell key is welcome to contribute.

<ul>
    <li>"I'm a hobbyist who only programs sporadically, but Moose makes OO programming a whole lot of fun. The documentation and examples have improved a lot since I first started playing around (back in the 0.2something-or-other days), which have helped considerably. Plus the developers are very responsive to questions, which is much appreciated when I start falling down a rabbit hole. If I could give Moose a higher rating, I certainly would. OO Perl would be a much sadder place without Moose." -- Thomas R. Helsel</li>
    <li>"What? I can only give it five stars?" -- ctbrown</li>
    <li>"I write less code thanks to Moose, I write better code thanks to Moose. Basically I am a happier person all around because Moose takes much of the drudge work out of my day. Thanks to the Moose team." -- Ben Hengst</li>
