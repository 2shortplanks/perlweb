<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.4.13
"Clifton." <a href="http://parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a> is a virtual
machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.4.13 can be obtained via <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>
(soon), or <a href="http://parrotcode.org/source.html">follow the
download instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.4.13 News:<br/>
<pre>- Languages:
 + Updated Lisp, Lua, PHP ("Plumhead"), Python ("Pynie"), ABC,
   WMLScript, and Tcl ("ParTcl").
 + Perl 6 passes all of the sanity tests.
 + PGE supports latest Perl 6 grammar syntax. Perl 6, Python
   ("Pynie"), and ABC parsers updated to match.
 + Updated PHP ("Plumhead") to Antlr 3.0.
 + Lua added the beginnings of a PGE/TGE based compiler (not yet
   replacing the Perl/Yapp compiler).
 + Lisp updated for current features, added a test suite.
- Core Implementation:
 + Filled in features and backward compatibility for PDD 15 objects.
   New object metamodel passes 85% of old test suite.
 + GCC API symbols are visible externally only when explicitly exported.
 + Added generated GCC compiler attributes to increase warnings, and
   cleaned up resulting warnings.
 + Code cleanup efforts and fixed memory leaks by the cage cleaners,
   resulting in notable speed increases.
- Misc:
 + Updated Parrot distribution to Artistic License 2.0, from dual
   Artistic 1/GPL license.
