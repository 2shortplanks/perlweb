Oakland (OAK) and San Francisco (SFO) airports are roughly the same distance
from Sebastopol. If you don't encounter traffic, the drive takes about an hour
and a half. Oakland's smaller and easier to deal with, but more flights come
into SFO. 

<h3>Driving Directions</h3>
From San Francisco:

<ol>
<li> Take US-101 North out of the city.
<li> Continue along US-101 (approx. 55 miles) until the Hwy. 116 West exit towards Sebastopol. (Don't be fooled by the earlier Hwy. 116 East exit.)
<li> Turn left at the light (at the bottom of the exit ramp).
<li> Continue to follow 116 for approx. 8 miles.
<li> Now you're in downtown Sebastopol. 116 winds through downtown, taking you past a small shopping center on the right that's home to Whole Foods. Be sure to turn right at the next light, which keeps you on Hwy. 116.
<li> Follow 116 out of town for approx. 1 mile.
<li> Turn right into the large parking lot with a light gray campus beyond. It's across the street from Taco Bell.
<li> Welcome to O'Reilly Media.
<li>The Tarsier conference room is a semi-detached glass-walled room behind
Building C, the building farthest to the right as you first turn into the
parking lot.
</ol>
