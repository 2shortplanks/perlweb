<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce its participation in Google
Inc's Summer of Code program, encouraging students to engage in Open
Source programming projects with funding provided by Google Inc.</p>

projects monitored by TPF grant managers. Specific students will pick
their own mentors, or the grants committee will assign them one.
