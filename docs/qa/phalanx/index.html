<h2>Perl's tests</h2>

Perl is treated as just another module to document.

Walk through the Camel and write a test for everything.

<h2>CPAN tests</h2>

Top 100 modules from CPAN

How the list is determined doesn't really matter.

The list will definitely be hand-tweaked.

Separate into strata.

Not strictly these 100 modules.  We welcome any improvements.

Our goals may change over time as the needs of Perl and Ponie
change.

<h2>What we're avoiding</h2>

<UL>
<LI>sprintf() breaking in PHP
<LI>(-3)**3 == 27
</UL>

<h2>What Phalanx will do</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Improve the tests and test coverage in Perl
<LI>Improve the tests, test coverage and documentation of the CPAN
</UL>

Bugs will be found.  They're out there.

<h2>Author involvement</h2>

Want to involve the authors.  It's good for everyone.

If they refuse, that's OK.  We can go without them.

We'll find some people who Get It, do their modules, and then make
it public what we've done.

<h2>Creating testing guidelines</h2>

Come up with good guidelines

Test the edge cases

Work it into the core.

<h2>Coordination</h2>

<UL>
<LI>http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/
<LI>phalanx@perl.org
<LI>IRC meetings at #phalanx on irc.perl.org
</ul>

<h2>misc</h2>

We WILL find bugs.  They're there.

Tests will get folded into the main distribution of the module.
We'll create the patches and feed 'em back.

We'll check documentation vs. tests vs. code, too.

Need a central place for the musterers.

The elf army slide is the key image.

Doesn't rely on Ponie.  Testing will be critical with Ponie.  If DBI breaks under Ponie, it's no good for anyone.

Need some sort of repository so people can collaborate

Check module dependencies

Need a tracking mechanism to track progress.  maybe an RT queue.

CPAN is the standard library of Perl.

Stats are approximate: Kwalitee

Many modules may not need much help.

Proactive defense

Use Devel::Cover and gconv

How much of the perl code and C code in the core is acutally covered by the core tests?

<h2>Todo</h2>

Questions to be answered

<UL>
<LI>What if we can't contact an author?
