In no particular order
======================

Order this list so more important issues are closer to the top.  :^)

Add the include_root to the Etag

Make the controller set the INCLUDE_PATH depending on the vhost (or document root?)
  - maybe use a separate configuration file so it's easy to specify
    pulling from svn or from a directory
    - possibly configured per branch?

Move urls to /about/ instead of /about.html

Map old urls to new

Make the siteinfo page not look like ass.  =^) Make sponsor list a
"friends of perl.org" thing.

Get content type from svn?  In any case: Handle .tar.gz files etc in
some way.

Cache data from the svn server; refresh when svn version goes up.
Cache .tar.gz files on disk or in mysql?

Cache full html outputs?  Use master svn revision in the cache key. Or
maybe use svn revision for perl.org/backend/ combined with svn
revision for perl.org/docs/[site]/.

We really don't want to use xhtml?  :-)  Maybe in a year or two I guess.

Lowercase all the html?

Set default style in the httpd.conf or in a combust.conf file.

Make the default.html style non-perl.org specific; use perl.html style
(maybe in turn calling default.html?) for the perl.org sites.

Handle If-Modified-Since requests.

Format POD as html when foo.html is requested and doesn't exist, but
foo.pod does.  Format POD as html when foo.pod.html is requested too.
