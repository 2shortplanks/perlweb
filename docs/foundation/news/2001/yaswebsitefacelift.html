<p>On March 15 Kevin Lenzo appointed Kevin Meltzer (KM) as the &quot;Web
Presence Admin&quot; for Yet Another Society. Because of this, KM has
redesigned the look and feel of the YAS website. Some of the content
is still coming in, and should be online shortly.</p>

<p>On Monday, March 26, KM put the latest version of the website 'live'.
If there are any questions or comments on the site design or content,
KM can be contacted at 
<a href="mailto:kevinm@yetanother.org">kevinm(at)yetanother.org</a>.</a>
