  PROJECT: enhance Maypole, a MVC web application framework
<p>

  AMOUNT: $1,000
<p>
  DURATION: 1 month
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
  Perl does not currently have an enterprise-ready web application
  frameworkwhich oversees the entire request process from web request
  through data sourceaccess, manipulation and output. Maypole is a new MVC
  framework for webapplications, similar to Java's Struts, but designed for
  minimal coding andmaximal flexibility.
<p>
  BENEFITS:
<br>
Many Perl programmers would save many hours when faced with trotting
out yet another web frontend to a database without requiring much code.
A Perl response to the popular Struts framework would fit the needs of
more heavy-duty users. Would revive more residual interest in Perl.
