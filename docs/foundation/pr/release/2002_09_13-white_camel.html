<h3>The Perl Foundation Announces White Camel Award Winners</h3>

Pittsburgh, PA - The Perl Foundation announced the recipients of the
fourth annual White Camel Awards at the 2002 O'Reilly Open Source
Convention in San Diego, California.  The White Camel Awards
recognize rare individuals who have made significant non-technical
contributions to Perl.  This year's recipients are Graham Barr,
Dr. Tim Maher, and Tim Vroom.

<p>
Graham Barr is the creator of the popular search interface for the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN).  Graham has been quietly
running the search.cpan.org website for years, providing a service that
thousands of Perl users rely upon every day.  Graham recently released
an updated interface to this website, making it even more useful.

<p>
Dr. Tim Maher started and leads the Seattle Perl Users Group (SPUG), one
of the very first Perl users groups.  Since 1998, Tim's efforts with
SPUG have kept it one of the most vibrant and active groups anywhere in
the Perl community.   Tim has also been instrumental in keeping SPUG a
friendly place for beginners to come and learn Perl,  encouraging
everyone to share what they learn about Perl with the group.

<p>                                                                                                                 
Tim Vroom is the creator of PerlMonks, a popular community website for
Perl users.  PerlMonks, a website designed for the "seekers of Perl
wisdom", is a welcoming place for participants to ask questions, post
observations, and submit code for the community to discuss and use.  Tim
has been been running and improving PerlMonks since 1999, and has made
it a very important resource for Perl users.

<p>
&quot;The Perl Foundation is glad to be able to recognize these outstanding
members of the Perl community,&quot; said Kevin Lenzo, President of the
Perl Foundation board.  &quot;Their contributions have helped to build a
friendly and productive environment for Perl programmers around the
world.&quot;

<p>
The White Camel Awards are named after the white, or albino camel, which
is rare and highly prized in lands where camels roam.  These awards,
originally conceived by the Perl Mongers, acknowledge outstanding
non-technical contributions to the language and community of Perl.  In
2001, the Perl Mongers merged with The Perl Foundation, a non-profit
organization dedicated to the growth and support of the Perl community.

<p>
The Perl Foundation (http://www.perlfoundation.org) is dedicated to the
advancement of the Perl programming language through open discussion,
collaboration, design, and code. The Perl Foundation is a unit of the
Yet Another Society (YAS), a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization based in
Holland, Michigan.
