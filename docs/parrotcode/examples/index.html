<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for
interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although we would like
to keep the door open for other languages in the future. As such,
Parrot will be the core of the Perl interpreter; it will be the target
platform to which Perl 6 code is compiled.
</p>

<p>
Parrot currently consists of an assembler and a virtual
machine. The best introduction to the Parrot virtual machine
is an article by Simon Cozens, 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/09/18/parrot.html">Parrot: Some Assembly Required</a>, and it is 
recommended that you read that before continuing.
Note that the pace of Parrot development is currently quite fast and
some of the details in the article are out of date. This guide
will attempt to keep up to date to the latest CVS Parrot sources.
</p>

<p>
Parrot is intended to be the virtual machine for Perl 6, but it is not tied to Perl 6.
In fact, we hope Parrot can be a valid target architecture and common language
runtime for many languages. This can only be achieved through detailed Parrot examples
and explanations - the purpose of this site.

Since Parrot provides two languages to generate bytecode, there are two 
separate sets of examples:
</p>

<h2><a href="pasm.html">Parrot assembler</a></h2>

<p>
Parrot assembler (PASM) is a low-level language which compiles directly into
the Parrot virtual machine. Unlike most other virtual machines (but
like most real computers), Parrot is register-based. It has 32
registers of four different types: integers, numbers, strings, and
PMCs. These are named <tt>I0...I31</tt>, <tt>N0...N31</tt>, <tt>S0...S31</tt>,
 and <tt>P0...P31</tt>. Most
Parrot operators have the same format: the name of the operator, the
destination register, and the operands.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="/docs/pdd/pdd06_pasm.html">
Parrot assembly language documentation (PDD6)</a> is the
main source of information about the assembly language, so you should
read that for full information about the language.
</p>

<h2>Parrot Intermediate Language</h2>

<p>
Parrot Intermediate Language (abbreviated PIR) (No, really) is a slightly 
higher level language than PASM. It manages the 
<a href="../docs/pdd/pdd03_calling_conventions.html">
Parrot Calling Conventions
(PDD03)</a>
transparently, provides improved syntax, register allocation, register
spilling, and more.
