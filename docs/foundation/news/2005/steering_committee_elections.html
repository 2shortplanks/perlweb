<p>
Bill Odom has been appointed president of The Perl Foundation, and
four new members have been elected to its Steering Committee, the Perl
Foundation announced today.
</p>

<p>
Allison Randal, president since 2002, is stepping aside to take a
more active role in Perl 6 and Parrot development.  "I endorse Bill
wholeheartedly," she said.  "Bill is calm in a crisis, follows
through on what he starts, and inspires others to do great work.
I can't think of anyone better suited to lead TPF through our next
steps of growth."
</p>                                                 

<p>
Bill started working with TPF at OSCON in 2004 when he organized
the exhibit hall booth and took charge of the auction.  Soon after,
he was elected to chair the Steering Committee. 
</p>

<p>
There are also big changes in the Steering Committee that does the
day-to-day work of TPF.  Four new members have been elected.
</p>

<p>
The Grants Commmittee will be led by Curtis "Ovid" Poe, who has already
distinguished himself as a grant manager for TPF.  His experience and
dedication, most recently with the Google Summer of Code / Perl Foundation
grant recipients, has shown how valuable Curtis is to TPF.
</p>

<p>
Long-time TPF member Jim Brandt is stepping into the role of Conferences
Committee chair. He assembled and managed the incredible team that
hosted the very successful YAPC::NA in Buffalo in 2004, and has used
that experience to help others organize subsequent conferences.
</p>                                                                            

<p>
New public relations coordinator Andy Lester, while new to TPF, is no
stranger to the Perl community. He's well-known as an outspoken, steadfast
advocate of Perl, and is definitely the right person to provide "Public
Relations the Perl way" -- honest, forthright, and useful information,
as the community rightly demands.
</p>

<p>
Kirsten Jones may be a new name to many, but brings a wealth of experience
to her role as the webmaster of perlfoundation.org.  A self-described
"serial volunteer," she's lent her considerable skills and energy to a
variety of organizations over the past few years.
</p>

<p>
TPF president Bill Odom said "I'm very pleased with the results of
these elections. We're fortunate to have such capable people willing to
volunteer their time and talents for the Perl community, and I'm looking
forward to working with all of them."
</p>
