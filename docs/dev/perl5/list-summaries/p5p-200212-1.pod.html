<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (28 december 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (2-8 December 2002)</A></H1>
<P>This week, besides some bug reports involving UTF8 locales, the porters
discussed a wide range of subjects, from Mathematics to English, not
forgetting about some old Unix thingies, such as system calls and
termcaps.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="alisiasing magic variables (in english.pm)">Alisiasing magic variables (in English.pm)</A></H2>
<P>Kevin Moore reported bug #18874 : sometimes, with perl 5.8.0, the $&amp;
variable is not correctly aliased to $MATCH. Andreas Koenig's little
gnomes quickly identified the patch that introduced this regression, and
it was reverted, with a proper regression test added. The root cause of
the bug is apparently that aliasing variables (via <CODE>*MATCH = \$&amp;</CODE>)
doesn't work as well with magic than aliasing globs (<CODE>*MATCH = *&amp;</CODE>).
In other words, it's a can of worms.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="mathematics">Mathematics</A></H2>
<P>Tels was busy this week on the Math::Big* modules. He fixed several
bugs, and apparently his fixes led to performance improvements.
I won't summarize Tels' eloquent missive, so here it is :</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89601.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89601.html</A></PRE>
<P>He also worked on the square root and nth root functions. Nobody
commented on his work, but I think that's because (1) these modules are
scary, (2) mathematics are scary, (3) quoting Tels, <EM>the deeper you dig,
the more sh*t you find.</EM></P>

    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89639.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89639.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="getservbyport">getservbyport</A></H2>
<P>Alan Burlison found that getservbyport(), unlike getservbyname(), doesn't
accept an empty string as its second argument (the protocol). This is not
consistent (and not consistent with the <CODE>getservent(3)</CODE> manpage.) Slaven
Rezic provided a fix.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="$env{term} and taint checks">$ENV{TERM} and taint checks</A></H2>
<P>After some discussion on the causes of bug #18717, Rafael Garcia-Suarez
put in minor change in the set of characters that are considered to be
safe in $ENV{TERM} regarding the tainting mechanism. Now, if you run perl
with -T, and if your terminal name contains a character which is
non-alphanumeric and not in <CODE>[-_.+]</CODE>, perl will consider $ENV{TERM}
tainted.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="more utf8 locale bugs">More UTF8 locale bugs</A></H2>
<P>UTF8-locale-related bugs continue to flood the porters. Wilbur Goltermann
reported bug #18857, about a <CODE>s///</CODE> substitution that fails with a
coredump, under a UTF8 locale. Vilem Marsik reported a bug in the perl
debugger (#18915) that appears to be related to a capturing regexp that
doesn't like UTF8. Bug #18931, reported by Bhavesh Davda, is about a
<CODE>\U...\E</CODE> expression not behaving correctly, also under an UFT8 locale.
It seems to be related as well to regular expressions. Last but not least,
warnings reported by perl are not UTF8-aware (bug-#5956-revival).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="extutils::parsexs">ExtUtils::ParseXS</A></H2>
<P>Ken Williams is working on converting xsubpp (the part of MakeMaker that
preprocesses XS files to C code) into a module, for which he proposed the
name ExtUtils::ParseXS. He explains : <EM>The reason I'm doing this is so
that the functionality can be used in other contexts, other platforms, and
other build environments like Module::Build.</EM> Brian Ingerson found the
idea interesting for Inline::C.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89698.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg89698.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Hugo van der Sanden integrated into the core the new version of perldoc
(and the relevant Pod::Perldoc::* modules), by Sean M. Burke. (This new
perldoc is also available from the CPAN.)</P>
<P>Nicholas Clark fixed the bug (#18651) reported last week, pertaining to
restricted hashes.</P>
<P>Rafael fixed three obscure memory corruption bugs in the lexer, and
apparently found some other ones.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="about this summary">About this summary</A></H2>
<P>This summary brought to you by Rafael Garcia-Suarez, both on
<EM><A HREF="http://use.perl.org/">http://use.perl.org/</A></EM> and via a mailing list, which subscription address
is <EM><A HREF="mailto:perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org</A></EM>. Comments and corrections are, as
always, welcome.</P>
