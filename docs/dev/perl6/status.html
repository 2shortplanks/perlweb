<h1>Language</h1>

<blockquote>The community brainstorming process finished August 1, 2000,
resulting
in 361 <a href="/rfc/">RFCs</a> (Requests for Change).&nbsp; They range
from suggestions to rants, and Larry is looking at them closely as he develops
the language.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Larry Wall is producing <a href="apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>,
language design documents that reflect his ideas of how the Perl language
will change between versions 5 and 6 (in parallel, Damian Conway is producing
<a href="exegesis/">Exegeses</a>,
sample code and explanations of techniques outlined in the Apocalypses).&nbsp;
The community is giving him feedback on the <tt>perl6-language</tt> mailing list,
pointing out possible sources of confusion, alternate routes, etc.&nbsp;
This can cause Larry to revise decisions he made in earlier Apocalypses.&nbsp;
When all Apocalypses are produced, commented upon, and possibly revised,
we'll have a picture of the perl6 language.</blockquote>
