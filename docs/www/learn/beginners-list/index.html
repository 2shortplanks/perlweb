[% page.title = "The Beginners List" %]

These mailing lists are for beginning Perl programmers to ask questions
in a friendly atmosphere. Flaming, rudeness, name calling, and food
throwing are not tolerated. Passive moderation is exercised in events
where list members can't control themselves.

Beginners need a place to ask a question that's been answered before.
They need a place to learn the simple things. Likewise, many helpful
people desire an environment that is open and instructional, where
they may teach and be taught.

If you are looking for help and need some friendly advice, join and
post to the beginners list. If you're a knowledgeable Perl programmer
looking to give something back, join and help us teach the new folks.
