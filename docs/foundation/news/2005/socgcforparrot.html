[% page.title = page.banner %]

<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's 
<a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> 
program and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects 
funded</a>. This is the second in a series of informal interviews finding 
out more information about these projects. Up now is Alexandre Buisse 
with "A Generational, Thread-Aware GC for Parrot".</p>
<p><b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b> <br>
Hi, I'm currently 19 years old and a french student in the 
<a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/">Ecole Normale Sup&#233;rieure de Lyon</a> 
where I am finishing my first year (that's equivalent to third year of 
American college). I am studying computer science, with strong emphasis 
on theory (I aim at specialising in computability/recursion/model theory
and cellular automata).
</p><p>
<b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b> <br>
I will write a new Garbage Collector for <a href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>
which is the virtual machine of upcoming Perl 6. I will certainly make great 
use of the GC that is currently included in Parrot (and another one 
written by Leopold T&#246;tsch but which was never finished), and 
also of those included in another language (mainly OCaml).  The final 
product is a new shiny GC which should increase Parrot performance 
and make multi-threading much easier.</p>

<p><b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br>
I am quite new to Perl 6 and Parrot, and that project was on the list
of TPF propositions for Summer of Code. As some of my courses included
GC design overview and as I like things that are quite low-level (OS
design, for instance), this seemed a good idea.</p>

<p><b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b> <br>
If the GC works well, that may allow some changes in Parrot design
(mainly variable-sized PMC). I also expect to have a lot of bug
reports for some time, especially after multi-threading is included.
</p>

<p><b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?
Got a blog?</b><br>
I created a <a href="http://nattfodd.blogspot.com/">blog for SoC</a>.
And I think I'll use a personal source control management software (I
like darcs and would like to try monotone) somewhere separated from
the official Parrot svn, in order not to break it in the process<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)
This scm will certainly be public.</p>

<p><b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br>
I had good hopes, especially as I received quite positive feedback
from leo. But I was initially rejected (and very disappointed) before
getting eventually accepted (thanks to someone who was accepted for
two different projects and choosed the non-perl one).</p>

<p><b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?</b><br>
It seems that I was the 410th on google list.
My acceptance was a mix of pure luck and fate<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>
