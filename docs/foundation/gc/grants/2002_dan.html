Dan has been a member of the Perl Community for a number of years
primarily doing work on the VMS port of Perl. He is currently the
internals designer for Parrot, the interpreter engine for Perl 6. We
think he dreams in VAX assembler. The work on Parrot has progressed
with the aid of the grant since Dan had more time to devote to the
project. We are excited to have been able to offer this opportunity
and hope we will be able to continue aiding the development of the
Parrot engine in the future.
</p>

<p>Dan notes the following as the most critical benefits of TPF
funding his work:</p>

<p><i>The biggest thing the grants have done is give me <b>time</b>.
Time to think, time to plan, and time to balance engineering
tradeoffs.  Designing the software to efficiently run perl 6 is a big
job, much bigger than I originally thought it was going to be.</i></p>

<p><i>Before the grant, I could tackle things in bits and pieces. That
works OK, but I had to take each piece individually--there wasn't time
enough to consider things as a whole. Because of that, the pieces
weren't fitting together well, and progress on the design was
slow.</i></p>

<p><i>The grant made it possible for me to think just about the design
of the engine. That was important. Perl 6 is much bigger than perl 5.
Normally with software this size, there'll be a half-dozen people in
the core team designing things, but since the folks involved are
volunteers and scattered around the world we can't do that. It's just
not feasible. That makes it even more important to be able to sit down
and get the design right.</i></p>

<p><i>While we're not done, the grant's directly responsible for the
design and the code being as finished as they are, and perl 6 will be
both faster and better for it.</i></p>
