<h1>Parrot 0.5.2 &quot;P.e. nipalensis&quot; Released</h1>

<p>15 January 2008</p>

<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.5.2
&quot;P.e. nipalensis.&quot; <a href="http://parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.5.2 can be obtained via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot">CPAN</a>
(soon), or <a href="http://parrotcode.org/source.html">follow the download instructions</a>.
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself,
we recommend using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
or <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/">SVK</a>
on <a href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/">our source code repository</a>
to get the latest and best Parrot code.</p>

<h3>Parrot 0.5.2 Highlights:</h3>

<p>&quot;make perl6&quot; uses the new pbc_to_exe tool to build a Perl 6
executable.  It's still a ways from being a finished implementation of
Perl 6, but we're working on that.  Come join us!</p>

<p>Parrot now has a LOLCODE implementation!  Not an &quot;enterprise-class&quot;
computing language, you say?  We don't expect anyone to use it for their
next app, but at less than 500 lines of source code (and most of that in
a subset of Perl 6), it demonstrates the power of the Parrot Compiler
Toolkit.  See
<a href="http://lolcode.com/news/i-haz-a-parrot">http://lolcode.com/news/i-haz-a-parrot</a> for more.</p>
