<h1>Parrot 0.5.0 &quot;Caulked Snack&quot; Released!</h1>

<p>
November 20, 2007

<blockquote>
<p>
Jack had avoided looking into his sons' faces during this Oration, because he
reckoned they'd not wish to be seen with tears streaming down their faces.  
But looking up at Jimmy now he saw dry eyes and a quizzical if impatient 
phizz.  Turning the other way, he saw Danny gazing distractedly at the White 
Tower.
</p>
<p>
&hellip;
</p>
<p>
&quot;Before you embark on a new life overseas, assuming that is your fate,&quot; Jack 
said, &quot;find Eliza and tell her she is my true love.&quot;  And then he jerked the 
chains loose from the restraining grip of first Jimmy, then Danny.  He leaned 
forward, pushed off against the rail with both feet, and launched himself 
into space above London.  His cloak spread in the wind of his flight like the 
wings of an eagle, revealing, to anyone who might be gazing up into the sky, 
a lining made from cloth-of-gold that glistered in the rays of the setting 
sun like the chariot of Apollo.  He was on his way down.
