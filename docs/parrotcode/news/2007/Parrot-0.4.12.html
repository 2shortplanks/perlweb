<blockquote>
    As I sailed into Shadow, a white bird of my desire came and sat upon my
    right shoulder, and I wrote a note and tied it to its leg and sent it on
    its way.  The note said, "I am coming," and it was signed by me.

    ...

    The sun hung low on my left and the winds bellied the sails and propelled
    me onward.  I cursed once and then laughed.

    I was free and I was running, but I had made it this far.  I now had the
    chance I'd wanted all along.

    A black bird of my desire came and sat on my left shoulder, and I wrote a
    note and tied it to its leg and sent it off into the west.

    It said, "Eric--I'll be back," and it was signed: "Corwin, Lord of Amber."

    A demon wind propelled me east of the sun.
