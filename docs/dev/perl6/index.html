<p class=fancyp><B>Perl 6</B> is the next version of the Perl programming language.<BR>
The project attempts to address the interpreter, the language, and the
culture. The internals of the version 5 interpreter are so tangled
that they hinder maintenance, thwart some new feature efforts, and
scare off potential internals hackers.&nbsp; The language as of
version 5 has some misfeatures that are a hassle to ongoing
maintenance of the interpreter and of programs written in Perl.&nbsp;
And finally, the entire Perl community is invited to participate in
the design and implementation of Perl 6.

<blockquote>"Perl 5 was my rewrite of Perl.&nbsp; I want Perl 6 to be
the community's rewrite of Perl and of the community."

<blockquote>
"The Perl 6 design process is about keeping what works in Perl 5,
fixing what doesn't, and adding what's missing. That means there will
be a few fundamental changes to the language, a large number of
extensions to existing features, and a handful of completely new
ideas. These modifications, enhancements, and innovations will work
together to make the future Perl even more insanely great -- without,
we hope, making it even more greatly insane."

<p class=fancyp><B>The</B> vision for Perl 6 is more than simply a
rewrite of Perl 5.  By separating the parsing from the compilation and
the runtime, we're opening the doors for multiple languages to
cooperate. You'll be able to write your program in Perl 6, Perl 5,
TCL, Python, or any other language that there's a parser written for.
Interchangable runtime engines let you interpret your bytecode or
convert it to something else (e.g., Java, C, or even back to Perl).

    Perl 6 Essentials is the first book that offers a peek into the
    development of the new Perl language while it's still in flux.
    Written by members of the Perl 6 core development team, the book
    covers the development not only of Perl 6 syntax but also Parrot,
    the language-independent interpreter developed as part of the Perl
    6 design strategy. This book is essential reading for anyone
    committed to the Perl community. It will satisfy their curiosity
    and show how changes in the language will make it more powerful
    and easier to use.
