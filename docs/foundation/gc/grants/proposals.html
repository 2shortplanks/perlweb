<p>
If you aren't the primary maintainer of the project you want funding
for, show that you have approval from the primary maintainer. 
<p>
We'll be marking proposal status on each submission, so if you have
several proposals, or several semi-independent segments of a proposal
it's generally best to split them into different messages.
<p>
To make sure we don't keep reviewing the same proposals long after the
proposer has gone on to other projects, we'll automatically mark a
proposal as expired after it's been reviewed in two quarterly grant
cycles (so, about 6 months).  You can always resubmit an updated
proposal.
<p>
All applicants will be notified of the success or otherwise
of their proposal.  For queries, more information or assistance 
with preparing proposals,
please contact <a mailto:tpf-grants-secretary@perl-foundation.org>tpf-grants-secretary@perl-foundation.org</a>

The following ideas were added for Google's <a
href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code 2005</a>. (Some
are more appropriate for graduate CS students). If any of these interest you,
contact the grants secretary above and we'll connect you with an appropriate
mentor.

<ul>
<li>Ajax library for Template Toolkit, akin to the Ajax support in Ruby in Rails (likely mentor: the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Catalyst</a> project).
<li>Put together a megadistro of Perl: pick guru brains to come up with the
modules they use.  Assemble a Makefile to build an install of Perl with
those modules, make sure everything passes 'make test', package the results as
RPM, .pkg, etc., and offer to the world.
<li>A visual SQL query-builder in Perl.
<li>Build a suite of tools around WxWidgets for cross-platform GUI apps with low overhead (i.e., don't require Tk or GNOME overhead).
<li>A Perl SOAP library including WSDL support.
<li>Automate smoke testing new Perl releases with CPAN (possible mentor: Adam Kennedy).
<li>Smoke testing architecture for binary compatibility between versions of Perl.
<li>Develop a strategy for useful benchmarking of the Perl core.
<li>Benchmarks for PGE (Parrot Grammar Engine) (likely mentor: Patrick Michaud)
<li> Profile Perl - measure the performance of the Perl interpreter using free
tools such as cachegrind, gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks
they reveal.
<li>Anything in the Perl 5 <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.7/pod/perltodo.pod#DESCRIPTION">TODO list</a>. 
<li>Polish up and finish off <a href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/20481">P5NCI</a> (likely mentor: chromatic).
<li> <a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/">LLVM</a> <-> Parrot interop (likely mentor: Leo T&ouml;tsch)
<ul>
<li> Parrot as LLVM backend (LLVM -> PASM)
<li> PIR -> LLVM (not really, but evaluate optimizations)
<li> Implement well-known optimizations in PIR compiler (SSA -> register allocation)
<li> Runtime & offline bytecode optimization
</ul>

<li>Parrot GC: generational, multi-threaded GC

<li>Parrot JIT: improve & complete JIT for some set of subsystems from alpha to
Z8000 i.e. several pieces, one per platform

<li>Parrot threads: STM (software transactional memory as in GHC, et al.) for Parrot
</ul>
