<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (30 september / 6 october 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (30 September / 6 October 2002)</A></H1>
<P>It was a busy week indeed, with long threads, interesting bugs, clever
fixes, miscellaneous optimizations, some new ideas, a few jokes,
mysterious failures, and, finally, a security hole. Read on.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="hash::util::lock_keys inhibits bless">Hash::Util::lock_keys inhibits bless</A></H2>
<P>Andreas Koenig reported that a restricted hash (that is, a hash that has
been marked as readonly), can't be blessed. In fact, no readonly variable
can't be blessed, and that's a feature. As Tim Bunce said, <EM>generally
hashes are locked by constructors and a constructor can bless it prior to
locking it.</EM> This behavior was thus documented in the Hash::Util manpage.</P>
<P>Nicholas Clark then proposed to mark restricted hashes with some other flag
than SVf_READONLY. This implies to find a free slot in the SV flags
bitvector. Tim Bunce pointed out that this property (to use a Perl 6 word)
can also be implemented as a new type of magic.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="just in time subroutine loading">Just in time subroutine loading</A></H2>
<P>Elizabeth Mattijsen requested comments on her new creation, <CODE>jit.pm</CODE>, a
module that loads modules and subroutines `just in time' (using the same
autoloading mechanism as AutoLoader and SelfLoader.)</P>
<P>Several porters didn't like the name, for several reasons : it's too
generic ; Parrot has already an unrelated JIT project, using the Java
sense of the acronym, so the word may confuse people ; it doesn't begin
with an uppercase letter.</P>
<P>Elizabeth finally decided to go for the name <CODE>load.pm</CODE>.</P>
<P>In the background, Tim Bunce suggested that AutoLoader and SelfLoader
could be patched so that the <CODE>-c</CODE> command-line option to perl triggers
loading and compilation of all subroutines.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="collections">Collections</A></H2>
<P>The biggest thread of the week -- 65 messages -- began with a question by
Christian Jaeger, about the possibility of having some sort of hash that
accepts references as keys without stringifying them.</P>
<P>Brian Ingerson came up with a comparison to Ruby, in which any object that
provides a <CODE>hash()</CODE> method can be used as a hash key. Semantic problems
arise when arrayrefs are used as hash keys, when they are modified, and
when they're used again as a hash key. Do they still refer to the same
hash entry ? Do another arrayref, equivalent to the first one, refer to
the same hash entry ? How to compute an hash code, or to compare for
equality two arbitrary complex objects ? And, as Brian wondered, <EM>isn't
that Elvis parking next to my car?!?!</EM></P>
<P>The hash code for a Perl data structure could be, as a first
proof-of-concept implementation, the MD5 checksum of a Storable
serialization. Brian proposed an implementation of this as a new pragma,
<CODE>keys</CODE>, that would <EM>turn on complex-key functionality for all hashing
operations in that scope</EM>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Tim Bunce suggested to rewrite <CODE>Tie::RefHash</CODE> as an XS
extension.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="overriden builtin misparsing">Overriden built-in misparsing</A></H2>
<P>Bradley Baetz reported that an overriden built-in function isn't always
parsed like the original built-in. He provided an example with die(),
which breaks the use of <CODE>CGI::Carp</CODE> with the Template Toolkit.</P>
<P>The problem is on code that looks like this :</P>
<PRE>
    die MyModule-&gt;my_method();</PRE>
<P>which is incorrectly parsed as <CODE>(die MyModule)-&gt;my_method()</CODE> when
<CODE>die()</CODE> is overriden. This comes from the indirect object notation, that
makes perl believe that <CODE>die()</CODE> is a method from class MyModule. Rafael
Garcia-Suarez provided a patch to the tokenizer to fix this behavior.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87354.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87354.html</A></PRE>
<P>Bradley reported also another bug on <CODE>die()</CODE> (bug #17763), occurring when
<CODE>die()</CODE> throws an exception object, for which stringification has been
overloaded : this exception gets incorrectly stringified before being
passed to a <CODE>$SIG{__DIE__}</CODE> handler. Nobody commented.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="the void context">The void context</A></H2>
<P>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes proposed a patch for the <CODE>our(%hash)</CODE> slowness
bug reported last week. Tony Bowden also ran some benchmarks on the
relative speeds of <CODE>my @x</CODE> and <CODE>my(@x)</CODE>. Stephen McCamant explained that
the `padav' op (declaration of a lexical array) doesn't have a specific
optimization for void context, and uses scalar context instead, and he
provided a patch, and a list of other ops that may benefit from the same
improvement.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87539.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87539.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="make too slow"><CODE>make</CODE> too slow</A></H2>
<P>Slaven Rezic noticed that make'ing a large module tree is much slower with
5.8.0 than with previous versions of Perl. If I understand correctly,
that's due to a limitation of command-line lengths in MakeMaker-generated
Makefiles, currently hardwired at 200 chars. He proposed to add a new
parameter MAX_SHELL_LENGTH to tune this, and also to look at the POSIX
constant ARG_MAX on systems that define it.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87342.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87342.html</A></PRE>
<P>Later, he also thought about <EM>making `make test' faster by using parallel
processes</EM>, and provided a proof-of-concept test script.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87700.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87700.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="safe.pm security hole">Safe.pm security hole</A></H2>
<P>Andreas Jurenda discovered a security hole in the <CODE>Safe</CODE> module (bug
#17744), and also suggested a fix. The <CODE>Safe</CODE> module provides a way to
construct restricted compartments, in which it's possible to eval some
perl code, while some ops have been forbidden. An opmask describes the
list of disabled ops. The problem is that it's possible to modify the
opmask from within the eval'd perl code; thus, if the safe compartment is
used again, it's possibly no longer safe.</P>
<P>This bug has been fixed in the development version of Perl, and Arthur
Bergman quickly uploaded Safe 2.08 (and then 2.09) to CPAN.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87643.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87643.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="memory stats interface">Memory stats interface</A></H2>
<P>H.Merijn Brand proposed an interface to the <CODE>sbrk(2)</CODE> C function, to help
tracing the memory used by a perl interpreter. This triggerred quite a bit
of discussion, because <CODE>sbrk(2)</CODE> has peculiar semantics, is not in POSIX,
and there's other equally unportable methods to stat the memory (for
example reading this data from <CODE>/proc</CODE>). The ultimate goal is, of course,
to help us producing a better perl, that consumes less memory resources
while being faster.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87502.html">http://archive.develooper.com/perl5-porters@perl.org/msg87502.html</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Alain Barbet continued to work on his web-browseable smoke database.</P>
<P>H.Merijn Brand reported that gdbm-1.8.1 breaks <CODE>GDBM_File</CODE>, but
with gdbm-1.8.2 the breakage is gone. So it's probably not a perl bug.</P>
<P>Brian Ingerson proposed that the CPAN modules could install their
regression tests somewhere in the lib directories. Then a <CODE>perltest</CODE>
command could be used to run them again. The changelogs could be installed
as well, and accessible via another ad-hoc command, esp. if they're
rearranged into YAML format.</P>
<P>While hunting down a bug, Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes discovered another one
(#17718) : <CODE>if(%h){...}</CODE> (or other boolean constructs) fail to test
correctly the emptiness of a hash if this hash is tied.</P>
<P>Rafael Garcia-Suarez added a new warning, <EM>Possible precedence problem on
bitwise %c operator</EM>, to warn about constructs like <CODE>($x &amp; $y == $z)</CODE>,
which is confusingly equivalent to <CODE>($x &amp; ($y == $z))</CODE>. This uncovered a
bug in a regression test for Storable.</P>
<P>H.Merijn Brand provided a first patch to remove 5.005-threads from Perl.
(They were deprecated in perl 5.8 in favor of ithreads.)</P>
<P>Chris Darroch noticed that using the <CODE>English</CODE> module and the <CODE>study()</CODE>
function together breaks <CODE>s///g</CODE>. Slaven Rezic proposed a very
simple patch -- that just disables <CODE>study()</CODE> when <CODE>$&amp;</CODE> is used in the
code. As he says, <EM>whoever introduces a performance hit in his script by
using $&amp; does not need the performance improvement of study :-)</EM>. Hugo
disapproved.</P>
<P>Dan Kogai released Encode v1.77.</P>
<P>The regression test t/op/closure.t fails mysteriously on some
configurations, apparently when using perl's malloc and without the
debugging code (the one that implements the -D command-line option).
Apparently this is caused by Dave Mitchell's pad.[ch] patch. Dave proposed
a fix, the smoke tests have to be run again with it.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="about this summary">About this summary</A></H2>
<P>This summary brought to you by Rafael Garcia-Suarez. It's also
available via a mailing list, which subscription address is
<EM><A HREF="mailto:perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org">perl5-summary-subscribe@perl.org</A></EM>. If you wonder why I switched to
yet another mail archive, here's the reason : Google Groups breaks threads
at subject changes, which is probably not the Right Thing, and the
xray.mpe.mpg.de mail archive breaks threads at month boundaries, which is
definitively not the Right Thing either.</P>
