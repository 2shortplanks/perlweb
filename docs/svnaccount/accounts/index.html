<p>Please see your specific project for access information</p>

<h3>Setup a Subversion account</h3>

<p>If you have been given or are in the process of getting commit
access to a project, go to <a href="/account">your account</a> to
setup your username and password.</p>

<p>The system will send you to <a href="https://www.bitcard.org/">Bitcard</a>,
the perl.org single-sign-on system,  to login and then when you are back here
you will get your svn.perl.org subversion and groups.pm.org webdav password.</p>

<h3>Forgot Subversion password</h3>

<p>If you forgot your Subversion or WebDav password, you can also <a
href="/account">get it reset</a>.</p>

<h3>Why do I need both a Bitcard and a Subversion/WebDav password?</h3>

<p>Subversion and WebDav requires us to save a cleartext password on
our servers.  We don't want the cleartext password to work for
anything but what it's absolutely needed for, so you get two
passwords.  One that you pick that we only save in one-way encrypted
format (Bitcard) and another that's autogenerated and saved in
cleartext (svn.perl.org).
