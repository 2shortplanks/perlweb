<h1>Parrot 0.5.3 &quot;Way of the Parrot&quot; Released</h1>

<p>15 January 2008</p>

<p>
On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.5.3
&quot;Way of the Parrot&quot; <a href="http://parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.
</p>

<p>
Parrot 0.5.3 can be obtained via <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot">CPAN</a>
(soon), or <a href="http://parrotcode.org/source.html">follow the download instructions</a>.
For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or help develop Parrot itself,
we recommend using <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>
or <a href="http://svk.bestpractical.com/">SVK</a>
on <a href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/">our source code repository</a>
to get the latest and best Parrot code.</p>

<h3>Parrot 0.5.3 Highlights:</h3>

<p>
The Perl 6 on Parrot compiler has now been given the name
"Rakudo Perl".  More details on the new name are available
from
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/35400">http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/35400</a>.
In addition,
Rakudo now has more support for objects, classes, roles, etc.,
and a better interface to the official Perl 6 test suite.
</p>

<p>
More languages are being converted to use the Parrot Compiler
Toolkit.
