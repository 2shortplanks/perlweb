=head2 Combust Features

=over 4 

=item MVC architected

Combust is primarily a set of "controllers" and utility modules that
makes it easy to write views (that's a fancy word for your content in
most cases) and models (if you are writing an application rather than
just a content site).

=item Clever integrated utility modules

Your custom controllers can easily use the Combust::Cache module to
cache data. Cache entries can be complex data structures, include meta
data, have individual expiry times and more.

Combust::Cookie takes all the work out of setting, reading and
validating cookies.

=item Subversion backed

It's not a requirement, but Combust is built to have it's documents
(templates, pod files) stored in a Subversion repository. 

Combust itself is in Subversion.

=item Automatic POD formatting

We write pod.  Web browsers read HTML.

If you have a "file.pod" file and request "file.html" the POD will
magically be converted to HTML and processed like it was a regular
HTML template.

You can also just include "file.html" in your HTML templates and
Combust will do the right thing.

=item Supports staging areas with branches and other goodies

=item Easy to install a local development version

=item Easy to reuse for other (unrelated) sites and web applications
