<h1>What is kwalitee?</h1>

Kwalitee is inexact quality.  We don't know exactly what it is, but we know it when we see it.

<h2>What is a bug?</h2>

If there is any disconnect between the docs, the code and the tests,
it is a bug.  Period.  The bug might be in the docs or the tests,
and the code is fine, but it's still a bug.

<P>

If there is ambiguity about how the code is supposed to work, it
is a bug.  The documentation must be clarified, and the code may
be out of sync as well.

<P>

If a hoplite discovers something behaving "incorrectly", according
to the hoplite,  it may or may not be a bug, according to the
author's intent.

<P>

<h2>What's a kwalitee module?</h2>

<ul>
    <LI>All dependencies in Makefile.PL or the Module::Build equivalent
    <LI>Well-tested
    <LI>Well-documented
    <LI>Documents match code match tests
    <LI>Covered well
    <LI>Pod passes Test::Pod
    <LI>All hyperlinks work
</UL>

<h2>What we're avoiding</h2>

<UL>
<LI>sprintf() breaking in PHP
<LI>(-3)**3 == 27
</UL>

<h2>Checklist</h2>

<UL>

<LI>All object creation is checked with isa_ok().  Constructors
are the most obvious, but any function that returns an object should
be checked that the object is of the expected type.

<LI>All temporary files are cleaned up.  Check the return code from
unlink(), and then check that the file is actually gone.

<PRE>
is( unlink( $filename ), 1, "Remove $filename" );
ok( !-e $filename, "Actually gone" );
</PRE>

</UL>
