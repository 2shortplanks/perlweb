<p>PROJECT: AnnoCPAN
<p>AMOUNT: $1,000
<p>DURATION: 1-2 months

<p>DISCUSSION:
<BR>
AnnoCPAN will be a web interface for the documentation of all the modules
on CPAN, where users can add annotations on the margin of specific
paragraphs throughout the POD.

<p>BENEFITS:
<BR>
There are many modules on CPAN that don't have mailing lists or
other discussion venues. Scattered discussions may happen in
various places,
or some users may post general comments on cpanratings.perl.org. However,
there is no central place where users can help each other by commenting on
specific features, uses, gotchas, tips, and tricks for all Perl modules. A
limitation of sites such as CPANRatings (and to a certain degree other
sites that host reviews) is that the comments appear out of the context of
the module's documentation, so they are necessarily general unless
the comment's author decides to write a long review to establish
context. AnnoCPAN intends to fill this gap by allowing users to add
public annotations on the margin of the documentation of every module
on CPAN.
