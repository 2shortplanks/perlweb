Jay Hannah keeps <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers user groups</a>
running. Perl Mongers started by providing free web hosting, domain
names, mailing lists, and other central services to make it as easy as
possible for new user groups to start and to attract Perl hackers in their
area. The maintenance of these services has always been a thankless job,
and the Perl community is fortunate that Jay Hannah keeps it working.

Josh McAdams, the host of <a href="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</a>
has made quite the name for himself since he exploded into Perl community
about two years ago when he was in Arkansas and started Perlcast,
the first regular podcast about Perl. Since then, he's interviewed
Perl luminaries as well as people connected to the Perl community
and re-vitalized the <a href="http://chicago.pm.org/">Chicago Perl
Mongers</a>.

been involved with Perl since its early days.  Randal has been a
tireless advocate of Perl and the community of Perl, and his
philosophy of giving back to the community is the epitome of the White
Camel.
