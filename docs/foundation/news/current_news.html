<h2>October 16, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/steering_committee_elections.html">New President, Steering Committee Members Announced</a></h2>
<p>
Bill Odom has been appointed president of The Perl Foundation, and
four new members have been elected to its Steering Committee, the Perl
Foundation announced today.
</p>

<p>
Allison Randal, president since 2002, is stepping aside to take a
more active role in Perl 6 and Parrot development.  "I endorse Bill
wholeheartedly," she said.  "Bill is calm in a crisis, follows
through on what he starts, and inspires others to do great work.
I can't think of anyone better suited to lead TPF through our next
steps of growth."
</p>                                                 

<p>
Bill started working with TPF at OSCON in 2004 when he organized
the exhibit hall booth and took charge of the auction.  Soon after,
he was elected to chair the Steering Committee. 
</p>

<p>
There are also big changes in the Steering Committee that does the
day-to-day work of TPF.  Four new members have been elected.
</p>

<p>
The Grants Commmittee will be led by Curtis "Ovid" Poe, who has already
distinguished himself as a grant manager for TPF.  His experience and
dedication, most recently with the Google Summer of Code / Perl Foundation
grant recipients, has shown how valuable Curtis is to TPF.
</p>

<p>
Long-time TPF member Jim Brandt is stepping into the role of Conferences
Committee chair. He assembled and managed the incredible team that
hosted the very successful YAPC::NA in Buffalo in 2004, and has used
that experience to help others organize subsequent conferences.
</p>                                                                            

<p>
New public relations coordinator Andy Lester, while new to TPF, is no
stranger to the Perl community. He's well-known as an outspoken, steadfast
advocate of Perl, and is definitely the right person to provide "Public
Relations the Perl way" -- honest, forthright, and useful information,
as the community rightly demands.
</p>

<p>
Kirsten Jones may be a new name to many, but brings a wealth of experience
to her role as the webmaster of perlfoundation.org.  A self-described
"serial volunteer," she's lent her considerable skills and energy to a
variety of organizations over the past few years.
</p>

<p>
TPF president Bill Odom said "I'm very pleased with the results of
these elections. We're fortunate to have such capable people willing to
volunteer their time and talents for the Perl community, and I'm looking
forward to working with all of them."
</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the winners of the 2005 <A
HREF="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel">White Camel</A>
awards.  The awards were announced today,  by David H. Adler at the <A

<dt><b>Stas Bekman</b></dt>
<dd>
Stas Bekman has been a tireless advocate for large-scale applications
in Perl and, of course, mod_perl. He went from an occasional asker of
questions on the mod_perl list to answering many questions, and had
the forethought to write it all down, creating and maintaining the
mod_perl guide which quickly grew to over 600 pages. Recently, he made
himself available for free talks to Perl Mongers groups during a trip
covering North America, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.

<dt><b>Eric Cholet</b></dt>
<dd>
Eric Cholet may be familiar to you as the technical manager of the
YAPC Europe Foundation and as co-author of A Conference Toolkit (ACT),
which has been used to administer several European YAPCs. More
importantly, though, he works behind the scenes at perl.org,
moderating the mailing lists we all use. If you've noticed the absence
of spam on a perl.org mailing list, filters help, but Eric catches
what falls through.
</dd>

<dt><b>Andy Lester</b></dt>
<dd>
Andy Lester is one of the prominent voices advocating testing and
quality assurance. He has written extensively on the importance of
good testing and maintains qa.perl.org. He is also the creator and
project leader of Phalanx, which is devoted to improving tests and
test coverage of Perl and CPAN modules to maintain quality as
development continues. Phalanx encourages interaction between
programmers by having groups of developers work together to improve
test coverage on the most used CPAN modules.

<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8

<h2>July 19, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/yapcna2006cfv.html">YAPC::NA::2006 Call for Venue</a></h2>
<p>With the close of another successful YAPC::NA, it is now
time to throw open the call for venues for next year's (2006) YAPC::NA
conference.</p>

<p>You can get details on what a YAPC venue needs at 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. 
When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and possible dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.</p>

<p>As with last year, we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a href="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a>
for more information on this. This shows
the catgeories under which venues will be reviewed to be able to bring
another great conference to you, at the lowest cost possible.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are
due by Friday, September 2 2005, with a decision due on September 16 
2005. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about N weeks,
which should be manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.</p>

<p>This is your chance to bring a YAPC to your town. It's a very rewarding
experience, and is a great way to give to the Perl community. If you
have questions about writing a proposal, you can send them to
<a href="mailto:yapc-venues_AT_yetanother_DOT_org">yapc-venues AT yetanother 
DOT org.</a></p>
