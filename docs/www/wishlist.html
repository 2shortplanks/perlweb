<H3>Wishlist</H3>

<ul>

<li>1U or 2U servers, preferably i386 or AMD64 for our <a
href="http://noc.perl.org/">various services</a> (web, email, revision
control, ...).  At least 8GB ram and room for two or more disks (we
have all our system disks mirrored).</li>

<li>Large PATA disks (for our big backup/storage RAID)</li>

<li>Large SATA disks (for some of our newer hardware)</li> 

<!--
<li>1U or 2U servers, in particular non-i386 ones (Alpha, Opteron,
...) for setting up smoke testing of perl5 and parrot.
-->

<li><strike>16+ port console server, preferably one we can ssh to.</strike> We got one from <a href="http://www.cyclades.com/">Cyclades</a>, it's awesome!

<li>Managed Gigabit Switches (~24 ports).  Bizrate got us a great
little gigabit switch we use for the internal network, but it's about
to be full.</li>
 
<!-- <li>Bizrate got us a <a href="http://xrl.us/bmii">gigabit switch</a>
for our internal net, but eventually it'll be full and we'll need more
ports. -->

<li>An industrial strength NAS - NetAPP or EMC or similar.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have some other useful spare hardware or can help in another
way, email webmaster at perl.org and we'll see if we can make use of
it.</p>
