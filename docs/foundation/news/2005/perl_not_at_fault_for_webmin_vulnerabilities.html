Two articles,
"Concerns raised over Perl security flaw"
(<a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2005/113005-perl-flaw.html">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2005/113005-perl-flaw.html</a>)
and
"Danger level rises for Perl app flaws"
(<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-5975954.html">http://news.com.com/2100-1002_3-5975954.html</a>),
point out an important security hole in the 
<a href="http://www.webmin.com">Webmin</a> web administration
package.  Unfortunately, these articles emphasize that Webmin is
written in Perl, as if Perl is the cause of the problem.  The problem
is not unique to Perl, and Perl actually has a distinctive built-in
feature that helps programmers fight this sort of coding error.
</p>

<p>
The problem of using format strings from untrusted sources goes
back to C, but doesn't go away with newer dynamic languages like
Perl.  A <tt>printf</tt> format string is source code in a mini-language
of its own, and should not be brought in from outside sources,
regardless of the language being used.
</p>

<p>
In C, this can be as simple as:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
untrusted_format = "%1000000d";
sprintf( buffer, untrusted_format, 1 );
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The buffer is overrun (unless it is at least 1,000,000 bytes long),
potentially smashing executable code and allowing an attacker to
inject malicious code bytes to be executed with the permissions of
the process.
</p>

<p>
In Perl, while the same sort of bad coding is possible:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
$untrusted_format = "%1000000d";
$buffer = sprintf( $untrusted_format, 1 );
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
the effects are much less.  Perl would allocate a 1,000,000 byte
string, which could be a resource drain, or may cause the interpreter
to run out of memory, but should not allow executable memory to be
modified.
</p>

<p>
Please note that <i>miniserv.pl</i> uses Perl's <tt>Sys::Syslog</tt>
module, and that <tt>Sys::Syslog</tt> uses Perl's internal
<tt>sprintf</tt> function, not the C library.  While there is indeed
a possibility that an attacker could mount a denial-of-service
attack, he should not be able to modify executable code.  (However,
a recently discovered <tt>printf</tt> integer overrun discussed at
<a href="http://www.dyadsecurity.com/adv/perl.adv">http://www.dyadsecurity.com/adv/perl.adv</a> 
means that there is indeed a possibility.)
</p>

<p>
The answer to these problems in all cases, especially in the case
of Webmin's <i>miniserv.pl</i> program, is to not pass untrusted
data into <tt>printf</tt> format strings.
</p>

<h2>Perl helps prevent errors with untrusted data</h2>

<p>
Keeping track of which data comes from where can be daunting for
the programmer, but Perl has features that make this easier.  One
of Perl's great unheralded features is variable tainting.  Perl
considers all data from sources outside of the running program as
"tainted."  Consider this extremely simplified, extremely dangerous
case:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
$dir = CGI-&gt;param( 'dir' );
$cmd = "ls $dir";
@files = `$cmd`; # Execute shell command and return results
# Now display @files to the user
</pre></blockquote>

The intent is that the programmer wants to get a directory name
from a web form, and get a list of files in that directory.  If an
attacker passes the value "; rm -fr /", the actual command executed
will be "ls ; rm -fr /", which is two commands: One to list the
current directory, and one to delete all the files in the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
With Perl's taint checking enabled, the programmer can't accidentally
make this happen.  Since <tt>$dir</tt> comes from an external,
untrusted source, it is marked as tainted.  "External untrusted
source" includes all environment data, data from sockets, and all
file input (see the <tt>perlsec</tt> manual page, at
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html">http://perldoc.perl.org/perlsec.html</a>
for a complete list).  When the Perl interpreter sees that it's
asked to execute a command from a tainted string, it refuses:
</p>

<blockquote>
Insecure dependency in `` while running with -T switch at ./programname.pl line XX.
</blockquote>

<p>
Taint checking is also supported in the <i>de facto</i> standard
database module <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBI">DBI</a>.
With taint checking enabled, tainted data cannot be used as SQL
statements, as parameters for data to be saved to a database.  This
taint checking can help ensure that the programmer doesn't inadvertantly
open up code to SQL injection attacks.  Further, data from a database
is marked as tainted upon retrieval.
</p>

<p>
Of course, programmers need to be able to untaint data from external
sources to make it safe to use, and Perl's powerful, integrated
regular expression handling makes this possible.  Programmers specify
that data must match a certain pattern, and extract only that data
that passes this safety check.  For common untainting tasks, the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI-Untaint">CGI::Untaint</a>
family of modules makes it a simple function call.
</p>

<p>
While taint checking would not have helped with this Webmin bug,
the Perl core developers are currently considering changes to
Perl's <tt>printf</tt> family of functions to fail if the format
string is tainted.  Perl's developers are also working to squash
the integer overflow format bug.
