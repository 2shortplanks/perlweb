<p>
If you aren't the primary maintainer of the project you want funding
for, show that you have approval from the primary maintainer. 
<p>
We'll be marking proposal status on each submission, so if you have
several proposals, or several semi-independent segments of a proposal
it's generally best to split them into different messages.
<p>
To make sure we don't keep reviewing the same proposals long after the
proposer has gone on to other projects, we'll automatically mark a
proposal as expired after it's been reviewed in two quarterly grant
cycles (so, about 6 months).  You can always resubmit an updated
proposal.
<p>
All applicants will be notified of the success or otherwise
of their proposal.  For queries, more information or assistance 
with preparing proposals,
please contact <a mailto:tpf-grants-secretary@perl-foundation.org>tpf-grants-secretary@perl-foundation.org</a>

The following ideas were added for Google's <a
href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code 2005</a>. (Some
are more appropriate for graduate CS students). If any of these interest you,
contact the grants secretary above and we'll connect you with an appropriate
mentor.
