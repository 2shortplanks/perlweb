<h2>Hello world!</h2>

<p>
The first example clearly has to be an example that prints out <tt>&quot;Hello
world!&quot;</tt>.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">.sub foo
        # Trivial example
        print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;
.end
</pre>

Running this generates:

<pre class="pre output">Hello world!
</pre>

<p>
First, <tt>.sub foo</tt> tells the compiler that we are beginning a subroutine 
called foo. In this case, the name of the sub isn't important, only it's
position - unless you tell it otherwise, parrot will execute the first
subroutine that's defined. The <tt>.end</tt> at the end tells parrot 
that our sub definition is complete.
</p>

<p>
<tt>#</tt> indicates a comment, and is followed by a fairly obvious <tt>print</tt> opcode.
</p>

<p>
Note that PIR requires that any code you give it <b>must</b> be placed in a
subroutine.
</p>

<h2>Temporary Registers</h2>

<p>
In PASM, you're required to keep track of all your registers. PIR lets you
use &quot;temporary&quot; registers, so you no longer have to worry about
register lifetimes.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">.sub temps
  $I99 = 1
  print $I99
  print &quot;, &quot;

  $I98 = 2
  print $I98
  print &quot;, &quot;

  $N64 = 4.2
  print $N64
  print &quot;, &quot;

  $S71 = &quot;Resting&quot;
  print $S71
  print &quot;\n&quot;
.end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">1, 2, 4.200000, Resting
</pre>

<p>
Note that by specifying a <tt>$</tt> in front of a register, we don't know 
which of the &quot;physical&quot; registers that is being used, just the type.
A trace of this program (<tt>parrot -t 1 temps.pir</tt>) shows:
</p>

<pre class="pre note"> 0 set I1, 1                        I1=-888
     3 print I1                         I1=1
     5 print ", "
     7 set I0, 2                        I0=-888
    10 print I0                         I0=2
    12 print ", "
    14 set N0, 4.2                      N0=-88.800000
    17 print N0                         N0=4.200000
    19 print ", "
    21 set S0, "Resting"                S0="(null)"
    24 print S0                         S0="Resting"
    26 print "\n"
1, 2, 4.200000, Resting
    28 set_returns PC5
    30 returncc
</pre>

<p>
The trace shows you the offset in the bytecode (useful for telling when
you've branched somewhere), the actual opcode used (our simple assignment
has been mapped to a <tt>set</tt> opcode, e.g.), as well as the values
of any of the registers (from <i>before</i> the opcode is executed).
</p>

<p>
So, these temporary registers map to actual registers in the PVM, but 
using them frees
the compiler writer from dealing with the details. Parrot's
PIR assembler will automatically handle variable lifetimes, and depending
on optimization level, may reuse 
actual registers when possible. 
</p>

<p>You should also note the last two opcodes: PIR is automatically handling
the calling conventions for you as the subroutine exits.</p>

<h2>Variables! Well, named registers</h2>

<p>
In addition to temporary registers, you can declare named registers,
which are effectively subroutine-specific variables. They don't
correspond to high level language variables.  (Those are
more likely to be declared as lexicals or globals.)
</p>

<pre class="pre code">.sub pie
  .local num almost_pi
  almost_pi = 22/7.0
  print almost_pi
  print &quot;\n&quot;
.end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">3.142857
</pre>

<p>
If you examine the trace for this code, you'll see that there's no
corresponding line for the <tt>.local</tt> directive above - parrot again
picks a register for us.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting note from the trace: our variable assignment is
converted to the appropriate <tt>div</tt> opcode. PIR provides syntactic
sugar for most of the arithmetic and comparative operators.
<p>

<h2>Branching and conditionals</h2>

<p>
Labels are presented at the start of the line with a colon. While PIR
does not provide high level language constructs like loops, with its
conditional handling, it's very easy to generate them.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">.sub loopy
        .local int counter
        counter = 0
LOOP:   if counter > 10 goto DONE
        print counter
        print &quot; &quot;
        inc counter
        goto LOOP
DONE:
        print &quot;\n&quot;
        end
.end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
</pre>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>
One of the strengths of PIR is its syntax for both defining and calling
subroutines that support
the Parrot Calling Conventions.
</p>


<pre class="pre code">.sub double
  .param int arg
   arg *=  2
   .return(arg)
.end

.sub main :main
  .local int result
  result = double(42)
  print result
  print " was returned\n"
.end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">84 was returned
</pre>

<p>
If you trace this program, you can see that it's handling the calling
conventions for us, setting up the number of arguments of each type,
setting the appropriate registers to the arguments. PIR will also
transparently handle saving registers around subroutine calls if
necessary.
</p>

<p>
Notice the <tt>:main</tt> directive on the <tt>main</tt> subroutine? This
tells parrot that when running this file, <i>this</i> subroutine should be
run first. Otherwise, the first subroutine we defined (<tt>double</tt>),
would be run instead. This bears repeating: The <i>directive</i> is what
makes this the main routine, <i>not</i> the name.
</p>

<p>
To get arguments for your subroutine, you can use the <tt>.param</tt>
directive to get named arguments, or manage things yourself, as you did in 
PASM.
</p>

<p>
When calling a subroutine from PIR, you can either use the name of another
local subroutine, as we have above, or you can use a PMC register that
contains an invokable PMC. For example, if you wanted to use a subroutine
from parrot's standard library:
</p>

<pre class="pre code">.sub main :main
  load_bytecode "library/Data/Escape.pbc"
  .local pmc escaper
  .local string result

  escaper = find_global "Data::Escape", "String"
  result = escaper( "This is an embedded newline:\n", "'")
  print "result of '"
  print result
  print "'\n"
.end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">result of 'This is an embedded newline: \n'
</pre>

<p>
One more PIR convenience you can see above.
Since most opcodes that have an out parameter have
that as a the first parameter, PIR lets you specify it as a left hand of
an assignment. So, the PIR above:
</p>

<pre class="pre code">escaper = find_global "Data::Escape", "String"
</pre>

is syntactic sugar for

<pre class="pre code">find_global escaper, "Data::Escape", "String"
</pre>
