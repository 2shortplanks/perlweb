<h1>Parrot 0.4.0 "Luthor" Released!</h1>

December 4, 2005<br><br>

<p>
On behalf of the Parrot team I'm proud to announce another
major release of Parrot. More than 530 svn checkins and 1000
added tests by numerous folks bump up the version to 0.4.0.
I'd like to thank all involved people as well as our
sponsors for supporting us.
</p>

<h2>What is Parrot?</h2>

<p>
Parrot is a virtual machine aimed at running Perl 6 and other dynamic
languages.
</p>

<h2>Parrot 0.4.0 changes and news</h2>

<ul>
<li> New lexical handling and closure support including better
  introspection for caller and outer</li>
<li> PGE (Parrot Grammar Engine) provides now compilers for P6Rule,
  P6Grammar, P5Regexp, and Glob</li>
<li> ca. 1000 new tests including 800 for Perl5 regexp</li>
<li> Improved unicode charset and encoding support</li>
<li> Calling conventions for exception handlers</li>

  of the config and test framework</li>
