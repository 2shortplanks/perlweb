<h3>Pete Sergeant</h3>

<p>PROJECT: To aid development of RTF parsing modules</p>

<p>AMOUNT: $4,000</p>

<p>DURATION: 3 months</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>

<p>Perl currently lacks decent RTF parsing modules. RTF::Tokenizer is
a first step towards rectifying this situation, but still the
situation remains. RTF is a ubiquitous format, and a format Perl is a
good at parsing - it's unfortunate that RTF support is still poor.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES:</p>

<ul>

	<li>Finish and maintain RTF::Tokenizer</li>
	<li>Document and add tests to RTF::Parser</li>
	<li>Create RTF::Reader, a framework for building RTF translators, as laid out in Microsoft's 
	RTF Spec</li>
	<li>Write numerous rtf translators based on RTF::Reader, but specifically rtf2txt, rtf2html
	 and rtf2xml</li>
	<li>Create a suite of applications for handling RTF files</li>
	<li>Create http://rtf.perl.org/ a centre for Perl RTF modules and discussion</li>

	<li>Attempt to implement an RTF::TreeBuilder</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daniel Grunblatt</h3>

<p>PROJECT: to port the Parrot JIT to IA-64 and HPPA</p>

<p>AMOUNT: $6,000</p>
  
<p>DURATION: 12 months</p>

<p>BENEFIT:</p>

<p>Daniel is a C programmer is working on on improving Parrot. He is
the author of the Parrot JIT engine, which now is running (some
programs) at speeds close to C, and the goal is to make that number of
programs higher.</p>

<p>Currently it will product output for the x86 on *BSD and Linux; ARM
and PPC on Linux.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVES:</p>

<p>Make the JIT engine work on MIPS, HPPA and IA64. Continue with the
development of it on ARM, alpha, PPC, i386 and SPARC. Keep enhancing
the Parrot Debugger.</p>

<p>WISHLIST:</p>

<p>Make the Parrot engine output an executable, which follows on from
his previous grant making the JIT output executables for x86 on Linux
and BSD.</p>

<p>PROJECT: Internationalize Slash</p>

<p>AMOUNT: $2,000</p>

<p>DURATION: 3 months

<p>DISCUSSION:

<p>Slash is the database-driven application server that powers
slashdot.org and use.perl.org.  It is currently the most widely used
open-source Perl solution for such tasks, and also one of Perl's
closest matches to Python's Zope/Plone content management system.</p>

<p>However, lack of internationalization and difficulty in
configuration have seriously hampered Slash's adoption. The current
way to localize Slash involves changing hard-coded strings inside
template files (and occasionally programs).  Each time a new version
of Slash is released, previous localizations are rendered obsolete and
need serious work to update them.  Having done this three times for
the Traditional Chinese language, I can testify that it is an
extremely demanding task.</p>

<p>Slash does not allow users to choose their own display language;
the entire site must use one set of language templates. This has
hampered international users' participation in both Slash development
and use.perl.org discussions.</p>

<p>BENEFITS:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attract more international contributors to use.perl.org and Perl development.</li>
	<li>Serve as an example for other web applications based on the Template Toolkit.</li>

	<li>Make slashdot.org and use.perl.org more accessible to non-English-speaking people, as 
	well as people with disabilities, by adopting a CSS-based layout.</li>
</ul>
	
<p>DELIVERABLES:</p>

<p>Modifications to Slash-2.3.x:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implement CSS-based and internationalized page templates.</li>
	<li>Chinese localization of said templates in PO format.</li>

	<li>Add an "Interface Language" option on the User Preferences page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Leopold Toetsch</h3>

<p>PROJECT: Rework Parrot packfile code to support multiple code segments

<p>AMOUNT: $4,000</p>

<p>DURATION: ~2 Months [1]</p>

<p>DISCUSSION:</p>

<p>The objectives of this project are to rework the Parrot packfile
code to deal with multiple code segments (e.g. for module loading and
evaluation). This includes separate constant and fixup tables and
reorganization of packfile structures with regard to multithreading
(currently prederefenced and JIT data can't be shared between multiple
threads).</p>

<p>BENEFITS:</p>

<p>Loading code at runtime is crucial for implementing "<tt>use
The::Lib;</tt>" and similar constructs.  This includes loading code in
source or byte code form and evaluating dynamically created source
code at runtime.</p>

<p>DELIVERABLES:

<p>Rework and cleanup of the <tt>pack*</tt> source files, very
probably resulting in all to be moved into its own sub-system
directory within the Parrot framework. Separate global and per-thread
data will be maintained.</p>

<p>[1] The time frame may depend on work done probably by Dan
Sugalski, as the necessary changes for multi-threading are not laid
out yet.</p>
