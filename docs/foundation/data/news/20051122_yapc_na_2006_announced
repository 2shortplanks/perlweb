Title: YAPC::NA 2006 in Chicago, June 26-28th

<p>
The Perl Foundation is proud to announce YAPC::NA 2006 in Chicago.
From June 26th to 28th, hundreds of Perl programmers will descend upon
the <A HREF="http://www.iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</A>
for three days of conference sessions and community, including some of
the biggest names in the Perl community.
</p>

<p>
Each year, Yet Another Perl Conference offers an affordable, accessible
conference put together by grass-roots volunteers, as part of the work
done by <A HREF="http://perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</A>.
This year, a team led by Josh McAdams, publisher of the popular
<A HREF="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</A> podcast, and Pete Krawczyk,
are putting together another great conference.  McAdams noted, "We have
a lot of big plans for the conference and a lot of expectations to live
up to. With low costs, a central location, and a wealth of local Perl
talent, be ready for a YAPC to remember."

The official website,
<A HREF="http://www.yapcchicago.org">yapcchicago.org</A>, will have the
latest information about the plans.
