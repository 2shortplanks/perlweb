Time to start thinking about those YAPC::NA::2004 presentations for
June! I'm pleased to announce the official <a
href="http://yapc.org/America/cfp.shtml">call for participation</a>
for <a href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::North::America in
Buffalo</a>. We're accepting abstracts for everything from 5-minute
Lightning Talks to half-day tutorials. See the <a
href="http://yapc.org/America/">YAPC::NA::2004</a> site for details.
The deadline is March 27, 2004. Looking ahead, we'll have registration
and accommodation details in February.
