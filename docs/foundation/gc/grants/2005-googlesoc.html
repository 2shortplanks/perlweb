<P>The Summer of Code is Google's program designed to introduce
students to the world of open source software development.</P>

<P>This summer, don't let your programming skills lie fallow. Use them for the greater good of open source software and computer science. Google will provide a $4500 award to each student who successfully completes a project by the end of the summer. </P>

<P>By pairing applicants up with the proven wisdom and experience of
established prominent open source organizations, we
hope to make great software happen. </P>

<P>The following proposals were accepted for perl:</A>


<H2>Refactor Pirate to be independent of the Python parse tree (AST).</H2>
<H3>Curtis Hall</H3>

<P>I will refactor the intermediate code emitter in Pirate so that it
is independent of the python parser.  The idea is to create canned
routines such as "WhileLoop.start()" and "WhileLoop.end()" that could
call the specific routines for any language.  A language's parser
would create an abstract syntax tree that would then be used by the
generic IMC emitter in Pirate to generate Parrot byte code.  Also,
there is still work to be done in implementing slices, floor
divisions, power operators, and to-string operators in Pirate.  I will
implement as many of these as possible with the remaining time I
have.</P>

<H2>Open Sourcing Perl/Java Integration</H2>
<H3>David Rusek</H3>

<P>Perl and Java are two very mature environments, each with their own
strengths. It is common to find both of these technologies in a
typical enterprise environment and therefore just as common to find a
need for integration between them. Often the use of Java and Perl
technologies in the same program can cause certain memory and/or
performance hits. This is especially true in short run CLI driven
programs. In addition, integration of Java and Perl often involves the
use of proprietary components out of the control of the development
teams causing various licensing or configuration issues. It seems
appropriate with recent innovations in the Java space made possible by
open source Java projects (such as GCJ and the GNU Classpath project)
that Perl should be able to take advantage of these innovations and
create a truly open source point of integration. The goal of this
project is to integrate Open Source Java tools into Perl thus
alleviating the need to use proprietary closed source solutions. A new
integration point between Perl and Java will be created, centered upon
the GCJ Java compiler. With the help of GCJ a Perl program author will
be able to 'import' and use a Java Class in much the same way they
would "import" Java code. In addition, GCJ, along with SWIG, can
enable a programmer to write and "XS wrap" Java classes for use in
Perl programs in much the same way they would for a C++ class.</P>

<H2>Compiler/Optimizer Improvements to Parrot</H2>
<H3>Curtis Rawls</H3>

<P>Parrot is a new virtual machine in development that will be the
target VM for Perl 6.  This project aims to make improvements to the
Parrot optimizer.  Specific areas planned for improvement are:
implementing SSA form, various self-contained optimizations, register
allocation, and documentation.  The ultimate goals of this project are
to improve the Parrot optimizer infrastructure and make Parrot code
run more efficiently.</P>

<H2>Extended Type Inference System for Perl 5</H2>
<H3>Gary Jackson</H3>

<P>I will be enhancing an existing compile-time type inference system
for Perl 5 to support aggregate data types, objects, and type
qualifiers.  The initial thrust of the work is to assign types to
arrays and hashes, the aggregate data types of Perl.  To this end, I
will disambiguate the use of arrays as tuples (such as the arguments
of a function) or as a list (the conventional use of an array).
Analogously, I will disambiguate hash use between records (as
typically used when representing objects) or as associative arrays.
Following this work, I will implement a subtyping relationship that
follows the inheritance of classes used in the program.  If time
allows, I will also implement a type qualifier system for evaluating
relationships among data (like Taint mode in Perl, but evaluated at
compile time).

<H2>A Generational Thread Aware GC for Parrot</H2>
<H3>Alexandre Buisse</H3>


<P>Parrot, the VM for Perl6 (and other languages), currently uses a
plain Mark-and-Sweep Garbage Collector. As it will be used on a wide
range of systems, from clusters to embedded, this scheme isn't really
optimal. It also does not consider multi-threading, which should be
included later in Parrot.  The project is to implement a new GC that
fixes all (or most of) these issues, by using a generational,
compacting scheme that protects shared objects.</P>

<H2>Perl MegaDistro</H2>
<H3>David Buchman</H3>

<P>The creation of a "megadistro," of perl, which will be packaged for
each and every distro. This package will contain the various modules
that are most used by experienced perl users and developers.  The
intent is to benefit the user -- the acquisition of the various perl
modules can be difficult, tricky, and most of all inconveniencing --
in that, they will be able to obtain and install one package, which
contains all the essential and useful modules, that one may wish
utilize. This will be especially useful for an inexperienced user;
even for an experienced user, a megadistro of perl will still prove to
be a major convenience. Ergo, such an install of perl will provide
both efficiency and convenience to the general public, particularly
since it will packaged for every major distro.  The project will
encompass, the compilation of packaging lists (the decision of which
modules to package for the megadistro), compatibility and testing, for
each distro, and the verification that the code will successfully pass
a `make test`, on each, respectively. After completion of this
project, the perl "megadistro" should be ready for mass-distribution.
