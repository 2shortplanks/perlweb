<h3>Release Notes</h3>

<ul>


<li>November 4, 2006: Fixed a few RSS bugs, added "alternate" headers
for the RSS.  A bunch of general code cleanup. Implemented a proper
API for the helpful votes.</li>

<li>September 12, 2005: Fixed problem with updating reviews. Thanks <a
href="http://cpanratings.perl.org/user/aristotle">Aristotle</a>!</li>

<li>August 25, 2005: Went through a bunch of the little TODO items.  Oh, and added a link to the until now well hidden <a href="/index.rss">index.rss feed</a>!
<li>July 20, 2005: Changed to use <a href="http://www.bitcard.org/">Bitcard</a> for authentication.  Added "was this review helpful" votes.  Also changed the URLs to be a little nicer (we couldn't do that while using the old auth server (don't ask)).  You can now add a review without giving it any ratings.
<li>September 28, 2004: Bugfix to the "show reviews" page by Ivan Tubert-Brohman.
<li>August 13, 2003: RSS finished, validating distribution names now, lots of other tweaks.
<li>August 11, 2003: Very much a beta.  Comments to <a href="mailto:ask@perl.org">ask@perl.org</a>.
</ul>
