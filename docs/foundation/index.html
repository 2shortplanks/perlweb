<h2><a name="yapcnacfv">July 20, 2004</a> - YAPC::NA::2005 Call For Venues</h2>

It's time to throw open the call for venues for next
year's <a HREF="http://yapc.org/">YAPC::NA</a>.
<p>

You can get details on what YAPCs entail
at <a HREF="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.
<p>
This year we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a HREF="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a> for more information on this.
<p>
Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are due by
Friday, August 31 2004, with a decision due on September
15 2004. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks,
which is short but manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.
<p>
You can watch the <a HREF="http://yapc.org/">YAPC.org</a> home page for any
more info or changes."</i>

<h2><a name="yapceucfv">June 28, 2004</a> - Call for Venue "YAPC::Europe::2005"</h2>

European YAPC's and National Workshops now have a foundation.
<p>
The main goal of the newly formed YAPC Europe Foundation is to provide
assistance on request to any European crew setting up a conference (be
it a YAPC::Europe or a national workshop).
<p>
The foundation can bring help in terms of experience from previous
organisers, resources: web space, CVS, mailing lists... (online
payment will also be offered), etc.
<p>
Of course, its chief concern is to make sure there is a yearly
YAPC::Europe, and while the Belfast Perl mongers are organizing the
YAPC::Europe::2004 conference in Northern Ireland with enthusiasm, YEF
is already looking for next years candidates.
<p>
Any dedicated crew interested in organizing the YAPC::Europe
conference in 2005 should send an informal application, stating their
interest, to:
<p>
"YAPC::Europe conference proposal" committee@yapceurope.org
<p>
Questions about the application and help to present it can also be
asked at this same address.
<p>
Deadline for applications: August 15th 2004
<p>
For general information about the venue requirements, check the
YAPC::Venue module on CPAN, and look at the previous venues at:
