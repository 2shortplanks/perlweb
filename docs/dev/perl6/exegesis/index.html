This is the first of a series of articles paralleling Larry's ``Apocalypse'' encyclicals (it's numbered 2 to keep it in sync with those Revelations). These articles will take each unveiled piece of the design for Perl 6 and demonstrate the new syntax and semantics in an annotated program.

In Apocalypse 3, Larry describes the changes that Perl 6 will make to
operators and their operations. As with all the Apocalypses, only the
new and different are presented -- just remember that the vast
majority of operator-related syntax and semantics will stay precisely
as they are in Perl 5.

In Apocalypse 4, Larry explains the fundamental changes to flow and
block control in Perl 6. The changes bring fully integrated
exceptions; a powerful new switch statement; a coherent mechanism for
polymorphic matching; a greatly enhanced for loop; and unification of
blocks, subroutines and closures.

Previous Apocalypses took an evolutionary approach to changing Perl's
general syntax, data structures, control mechanisms, and
operators. New features were added, old features removed, existing
features were enhanced, extended, and simplified. But the changes
described were remedial, not radical.  Larry could have taken the same
approach with regular expressions.  Fortunately, however, he's taking
a much broader view of Perl's future than that.

This Exegesis explores the new subroutine semantics described in 
Apocalypse 6. Those new semantics greatly increase the power and 
flexibility of subroutine definitions, providing required and optional
formal parameters, named and positional arguments, a new and extended 
operator overloading syntax, a far more sophisticated type system, 
multiple dispatch, compile-time macros, currying, and subroutine
wrappers.
