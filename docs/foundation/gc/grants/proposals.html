<p>
If you aren't the primary maintainer of the project you want funding
for, show that you have approval from the primary maintainer. 
<p>
We'll be marking proposal status on each submission, so if you have
several proposals, or several semi-independent segments of a proposal
it's generally best to split them into different messages.
<p>
To make sure we don't keep reviewing the same proposals long after the
proposer has gone on to other projects, we'll automatically mark a
proposal as expired after it's been reviewed in two quarterly grant
cycles (so, about 6 months).  You can always resubmit an updated
proposal.
<p>
Unfortunately we don't have time to write a personal message to every
person who writes a proposal. We get some great proposals. Most of
them we would approve if we could, we just don't have the funds to
cover every project.
