=head1 This Week on perl5-porters - 8-14 May 2006

"Trust me on this one; I spent three years trying to kill v-strings
and all I managed to do was to defang them in the more recent 5.8.x
series." -- John Peacock

=head1 Topics of Interest

=head2 Putting C<Tie::RefHash> on CPAN

One of the items on the list of things to do for Perl 5.10 is to
"dual life" everything. That is, give all core modules a
counterpart on CPAN, in order to correct bugs and introduce
enhancements in a more timely manner.

Yuval Kogman wanted to know how to go about doing just that for
C<Tie::RefHash>, a module he now maintains. Andreas Koenig
performed the required paper work on PAUSE, and it was done.

=head2 Things that go BOOM! on the context stack

Nicholas Clark started to work on the problem of warnings during
the constant folding optimisation step crashing due to internal
panics. The problem is that constant folding is a compile-time event
that appears to take effect at run-time. Unfortunately, the constant
folding code is not itself immune to run-time effects.

For instance, Perl being the dynamic language that it is, it is
possible for a C<__WARN__> signal handler to be fired while the
program is being compiled. And depending on what that handler does,
sometimes that can really ruin your day.

Nicholas thought of a first approach, which Dave Mitchell identified
as being unworkable. So Dave solved the problem elegantly, by simply
switching off the C<warn> and C<die> handlers while the folding of
constants is taking place at compile time.

=head2 Adding macros to Perl5

Another key milestone on the way to perl 5.10 is the notion of
assertions, that work like C's C<assert>s. Nicholas Clark was wondering,
some time back, if it could be possible to implement assertions
outside of the core.


In order to I<really> pull this off, Salvador Fandiño figured that
Perl needed real (Lisp-like) macros. And he did just that, by
allowing a C<:macro> attribute to be applied to a subroutine
definition.

Rafael Garcia-Suarez wondered whether this could be dealt with by
C<Attribute::Handlers>. Salva pointed out that that module does its
magic far too late in the game, at C<INIT> or C<CHECK> time, at
which point it is too late to modify the op-tree, since it has
already been built.

Joshua ben Jore, as the I<de facto> C<B::> maintainer suggested that
Salva take C<B::Generate>, and enhance it do to the required footwork
instead of introducing a new B module.

=head2 Removing C<sv_derived_from> from the public API

chromatic wanted to remove the documentation (although not the
implementation) of C<sv_derived_from>t, since using it on a blessed
C<SV> can lead to incorrect results if C<isa()> has been overloaded.

Jan Dubois is used to using this routine, and for him it works as
advertised, so he was a bit puzzled by chromatic's statement that
using it "is almost always wrong". John Peacock was also opposed to the
idea, commenting on how hard it is to get something out of perl once
it gets in.

It turns out that the heart of the matter is C<Test::MockObject>,
which cannot be made to work correctly if classes overload their
own C<isa> functions. Jan Dubois identified the heart of the problem:
squeezing the information concerning implementation and interface
inheritance through the same mechanism, and went on to sketch out
a technique to deal with both situations cleanly.

Rafael liked Jan's idea, and asked for a more precise specification.
chromatic patched F<universal.c> to push it in that direction,
borrowing the C<does> method from Perl 6. Fergal Daly thought
that perhaps there might be code out there that already C<does>
stuff, and to play it safe at this late stage of the game it
might be wiser to name the method C<DOES>.

In another sub-thread, chromatic thought that maybe the
behaviour of C<sv_derived_from> could be changed to operate
differently, and if XS writers needed the old behaviour, they
could pick it up by calling a new method. Jan Dubois thought
that that was exactly backwards.

Marvin Humphrey, who is heavily into this sort of stuff was
interested in a clean approach, but one that did not entail a
performance hit, since Perl methods calls are already expensive
enough as it is.

In the end, chromatic supplied a documentation patch which
clarified how and when to use C<sv_derived_from>, which
Rafael happily applied.

  The patch at the end of the universe

=head2 Getting C<threads> to do your bidding

Last week, work on C<threads> broke on Windows. Jerry
D. Hedden supplied a patch which straightened out that problem.

  Windows repair man
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00295.html

The real discussion, however, began when Jerry asked for some help
in adding the capability of cancelling a thread. He thought of an
approach that just might work, but wasn't too sure about the finer
details of diddling a thread's op-tree to cause it to terminate.

Liz Mattijsen was intrigued by the possibility and commented that
if Jerry was able to succeed, it would be nice to extend the work
in order to add some sort of suspend/resume functionality, then she
could put a thread on ice for a while, which would be very useful.

Jan pointed out that it was possible to deliver a signal from C to
a thread. Jerry wondered if that could be used to deliver a C<__DIE__>
signal to a thread. The main problem with this approach is that
C<die()> and C<warn()> are not true signals, they just use C<%SIG>
as a convenient place for pointing to their exception handlers.

To use this approach, one would need to invent a new signal name
with an unused numeric value. As this is guaranteed to be highly
platform-dependent, a certain amount of C<Configure> work would be
required. After that, one would be able to deliver a new pseudo-signal
to the interpreter, and thereby kill, or otherwise incapacitate,
your thread.

Jerry sketched out some sample code to show what the implementation
would look like. This elicited a few remarks, but no show-stoppers,
so he started to work on it in more detail.

  Signal processing
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00335.html

The discussion then segued in more detail into the issue of suspending and
resuming threads. Liz explained that her C<Thread::Suspend> module,
that currently only works on certain vintage Linux kernels could be
refitted to use this functionality. And it would be Good.

Jan lent his deep understanding of Perl internals to help flesh
out the idea of using a fake signal. He noted that there used to
be a C<Perl_raise_signal> function that would have been very useful
in this context, but in C<blead> is has become a private static
function. This made Rafael wonder whether the privatisation had been
the right move, and that maybe it should be made public again.

It turns out that the function had been zinged by Andy's wand
of const refactoring goodness, largely because poor internals
documentation had not identified its possible public use.

Dave Mitchell cautioned that it is deceptively easy to forget or
drop pending requests if the proper safeguards are not in place
to ensure atomic updates to the C variables that control
signal delivery. Worse, if the signals come too closely together,
it may not be possible to determine in which order to apply them
unless a full-blown action queue is implemented.

Jan Dubois proposed an alternate algorithm using a signal and
a semaphore, for which Dave, at least for the time being, could
not find fault with.

  Holding the flag
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00341.html

Jerry delivered a first cut at signalling, which Jan commented
on, explaining that the approach would not work on Windows,
simply due to the nature of the beast, and that the code could
probably be simplified with little risk.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00400.html

Jerry then delivered a more complete patch to allow a kill()
method to be used on a thread, to send it signals. Rafael made
a couple of suggestions, to improve consistency in the way it
deals with things such as signal names and error messages.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00406.html

So Jerry took these considerations on board and revised the patch.
Nicholas had to tweak it slightly in order to get it to pass its
test suite on FreeBSD. Trying to do this stuff portably is a
nightmare. Who knows what Unicos or VMS are going to make of it.

Jan Dubois took issue with the suspend/resume semantics, arguing
that if a thread receives two suspend signals, when it receives a
subsequent resume signal, it should revive immediately, rather than
continuing to wait for a second resume signal. Jerry thought that
these different strategies should be handled by other modules.

  A question of semantics
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00427.html

Winding up for the week, Jerry improved the documentation to describe
the issues surrounding safe signals and unsafe signals with respect to
threads.

=head1 Patches of Interest

=head2 Proper use of static functions in F<toke.c> and F<pp_sys.c>

Andy Lester applied some elementary preprocessor magic to a
static C<printf>-like function, which means that the function
signature could be changed.

When compiled with C<gcc>, the function signature can then supply
the necessary information to have attribute checking performed on
the format string passed to the underlying C<printf> code. This
identifies things like '%s' is being used to print an C<int> at
compile-time, thereby avoiding considerable grief and heartache at
run-time.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00343.html

He then spotted a problem with F<embed.fnc>, that was not
declaring a function as being able to accept a C<NULL>.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00437.html

And a tweaklet to speed up F<utf8.c>

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00438.html

Andy then tinkered with C<bytes_to_uni>, bringing it into line
with F<embed.fnc> best practices. In doing so, this brought the
function up on Sadahiro Tomoyuki's radar, who realised that
C<S_bytes_to_uni> in F<pack.c> is nearly the same as F<utf.c>'s
C<Perl_bytes_to_utf8> function.

Tomoyuki reworked C<S_bytes_to_uni> to get it to do its job without
requiring a scratch buffer. He also pointed out a missing gap in
the orthogonality of functions converting back and forth between
bytes and UTF-8, although this elicited no comments.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00439.html

=head2 Various F<t/op/*.t> files using F<test.pl>

The summariser, finding the traffic a little light this week, sent
in a patch to add shiny F<test.pl> goodness to a number of files
in the test suite. Unapplied.

  Obviously some sort of oversight
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00393.html

=head2 C<sprintf> and variadic macros

Robin Barker spotted a problem with patch #27987, in that
it created a pair of source code fragments that must be kept in
sync. He proposed a patch that used variadic macros (as per the
C 89 standard). An old Sun compiler that Andy Dougherty had
at hand choked on this.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00422.html

Since the porters want Perl to run on as many platforms as is
reasonably possible, and since using variadic macros (macros that
may take a varying number of parameters, in case you were wondering)
would wipe out a number of older platforms in one fell swoop, Jarkko
Hietaniemi proposed an alternate take, using variadic functions
(which have been available in one form or another in C since just
about forever).

  Third time lucky
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00431.html

Nicholas Clark thought that, all the same, if a platform did have
usable variadic macros, it would be nice to be able to use them,
thus avoiding the cost of plunging through a function call to do
the deed.

=head1 New and old bugs from RT

=head2 What Steve Peters did this week

Steve closed out bug (#7014), since these days, an embedded C<\0> in
a C<die> or C<warn> string no longer causes the following characters in the
string to be discarded,

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00397.html

noted that when a C<make test> hangs on AIX 4.3.3 and cannot be killed
(#21328), upgrading the compiler is as good a fix as any.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00403.html

pointed out that it is all very well to install a free .NET compiler,
(#21607), but to get anywhere, you also need to install the Windows
SDK.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00408.html

closed an old bug by noting that it had been fixed by an old change (#21944).

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00398.html

explained that trying to use a C<gcc> compiler built for AIX 4.3.2 on an
AIX 4.3.3 will only end in tears. (#23111)

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00404.html

tickled an three year old bug concerning leading spaces and C<Inf> infinity (#23731)

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00413.html

made a brief addition to F<perlop.pod> based in the the suggestion that C<qx/STRING/>
should mention C<STDIN> (#34288)

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00411.html

and another note in the configuration hints for Linux, pertaining to the IA64
platform (#37156)

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00410.html

=head2 Perl is not flexible when selecting vendor install paths (#39069)

Andy Dougherty showed another simple trick to do at configuration
time in order to rebuild perl with the same settings as a
vendor-supplied perl.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00449.html

=head2 Regexp optimizer loses its hopes too soon (#39096)

Ruud Affijn showed how the C</m> flag, C<^> and C<$> can conspire to
drag the performance of the regexp engine down into the abyss of
exponential backtracking.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00279.html

=head2 C<Pod::Html> error stops CPAN install/test of C<Pod::Readme> (#39098)

Randy W. Sims returned to the problem of modules not being installed
simply because the build failed to generate HTML from the POD.
Since this behaviour was judged to be a little too drastic, Randy
outlined some possible scenarios to resolve the situation.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00311.html

=head2 Perl on AIX 64 bit problem (#39100)

Daljit Singh has an IBM AIX computer, but no IBM C compiler, and
wanted to install a 64-bit perl to speak to his 64-bit Oracle
instance. This meant using C<gcc>. He was, however, getting some
compile errors, for which H.Merijn Brand offered a diagnosis.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00296.html

=head2 C<pod2man> omits C<.SH NAME> section (#39106)

Ben Okopnik noticed that C<pod2man> does not create a C<.SH NAME>
section in the man pages it generates. Consequently, programs like
C<mandb> produce copious amounts of warnings when the man page index
is rebuilt.

Rafael Garcia-Suarez explained that C<pod2man> does, except when
the original POD file lacks a C<=head1> section in the first place,
so he documented the offending files correctly.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00325.html

=head2 Internal error in F<Bytecode.pm> (#39110)

Bart Bartholomew discovered using C<-MO=Bytecode> to emit bytecode
no longer works. Joshua ben Jore wasn't sure that anyone was even
maintaining C<B::Bytecode> any more, and he should know, since he
is about the only person poking around in C<B::> these days.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00377.html

=head2 C<sprintf> with UTF-8 format string and ISO-8859-1 variables (#39126)

Willem-Jan Veen discovered that if you have a format string for
C<sprintf> encoded in UTF-8, and use it to format a string encoded
in ISO-8859-1, the program dies a horrible death. Willem-Jan was
the first to admit that wanting to do such a thing was rather
strange, but thought that the resulting core dump was not the most
useful result.

Dominic Dunlop was not able to reproduce the failure, except by
using an custom C<malloc> library that contains aggressive debugging
checks. In the meantime, Willem-Jan had found a workaround, which
simply consisted of ensuring that the format string is never encoded
in UTF-8.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00419.html

=head2 Failure not always detected in C<IPC::Open2::open2> (#39127)

Vincent Lefevre wondered why opening a program that doesn't actually
exist does not always give rise to a trappable error.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00420.html

=head2 h2ph generates incorrect code for '#if defined A || defined B' (#39130)

Jason Vas Dias noted that C<h2ph> can emit code that cannot be compiled
on Linux PPC64 platforms and proposed a patch to make it emit saner code.

=head1 In Brief

Larry explained the meaning of B<the MAD keys>. (This reply appeared the
week before, but I managed to delete the item in last week's summary).

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00185.html

(as did a patch to squelch the B<use of C<chop> in F<perlport.pod>>).

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00082.html

Nicholas Clark announced the arrival of B<new Coverity findings>. Andy
Dougherty noticed that many of them had already been analysed, which means
that the information was not being retained.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00320.html

The B<F<ext/IPC/SysV/t/ipcsysv.t> patch> caused a bit of trouble,
but was eventually beaten into submission.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00313.html

A B<minor typo in F<perlfaq4.pod>> was cleared up, but a more minor
(or more important, if you are into typography) issue concerning em
dashes was left in, because life is too short.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00326.html

Vadim continued on the Win32/Wince merger, and supplied B<a C<Wince
crosscompile patch>> to keep things happy.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00324.html

Nicholas Clark found an B<off-by-one in C<no>> error, and suggested a
token fix in F<pp_ctl.c> to make it do the right thing. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
wondered if the fix was appropriate for C<maint>.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00368.html

Nicholas was also surprised that B<parsing changes in blead> caused
C<Tk> to fail, since C<$#{@$arrayref}> now fails with a run-time
error. (One should of course be using C<$#$arrayref>).

Anthony Heading wondered whether the B<bogus C<gcc> behaviour seen by
Nicholas Clark> was not simply due to confusion between C and C++ on
the part of the compiler authors.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00405.html

Jarkko sent in a small patch for F<sv.c>, since B<C<printf %d> wants
an C<int> not C<size_t>>.

=head2 About this summary

This summary was written by David Landgren.

=head2 Last week's summary

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-05/msg00445.html

garnered one response, concerning C<Data::Dumper>'s propensity to
quote numeric values needlessly. Brad Baxter followed up on the
thread, saying that the underlying problem, of which C<Data::Dumper>
was only a symptom, was that if the operand on the right hand side
of a numeric comparison is C<undef>, the left hand side is not
marked as having been used in numeric context (technically, the
C<SvIOK> flag is not set).
