<p>Beginning Perl is a different kind of Perl book. It's written
particularly with the beginning programmer in mind, but it doesn't
treat you like an idiot, and experienced programmers will not feel
patronised.  It covers a lot of ground, from the very basics of
programming, right through to developing CGI applications for the
web. More importantly, it emphasises good Perl practice, and readable
and maintainable code.

<p>
You write code for a living, and your inherit a legacy program written
in perl. You can program in your native language in your sleep. But
you don't know perl at all, or you've only dabbled with it. Your
deadline doesn't give you enough time to rewrite the legacy program in
your native language, but it needs new features. You need to learn
perl, and you need to learn it NOW. "Impatient Perl" was written for
you.

<p>MacPerl: Power and Ease is designed for both the beginner to Perl,
and those who want to take advantage of Perl on Mac OS. It's divided
into three primary sections: learning about programming, learning
about Perl, and advanced topics. The latter includes brief sections on
objects and references, and more complete information on how to use
the Mac toolbox modules for making windows and dialog boxes and using
AppleScript with Perl. It covers the MacPerl based on perl 5.004, and
Mac OS (Classic), but much of the first two parts apply to any
platform, and much of the third part applies to Mac OS X

problem and select among them. The book covers the latest line of

<P>This book has been created for a number of reasons. The primary
reason is to provide a freely redistributable tutorial for the Perl
language. In writing this freely redistributable tutorial, it is our
hope that the largest number of people can have access to it and share
it.
</P>

<P>In the Perl community, we have discovered ways to save time by
writing Perl programs that make our jobs and lives easier. Surely,
Perl is not a panacea, but it has certainly made our lives a little
bit better. It is hoped that you can use Perl to make your jobs and
lives easier, too.
