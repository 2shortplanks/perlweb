<p>
Each week, a group of developers working on Parrot and Parrot-related
projects gathers online to discuss progress, changes and the state
of the metaphorical weather.  This meeting currently occurs each
Tuesday at 18:30 UTC, in the #parrotsketch channel on irc (irc.perl.org).
</p>

<p>
Participating in the meeting is by invitation only, however
lurkers are welcome, and non-invitees may send private messages
to the participants with questions to be asked or answered.
The full logs of each meeting are 100% public.
