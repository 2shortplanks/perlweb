<h4>Email</h3>
We hate spam and waste more time dealing with spam than most. We'll
naturally not give your email address to anyone not related to the
operations of perl.org. We'll also not use your address for anything
not related to your mailinglist subscription here. In particular we'll
not send spam to you.

</p>
<p>

However, if you choose to post to a mailinglist, your email address
will go to hundreds if not thousands of other subscribers and numerous
list archives. For that reason you might want to subscribe with an
address you can throw away if it starts getting spammed more than you
can bear.

</p>
<p>


We're commited to keeping the lists themselves as free from spam as
possible, and for the last few years our success rate is a few
delivered spams through our system against many millions of real list
postings.

<h4>Cookies</h4>

We use cookies to track sessions. Except if you login, the session
data doesn't have any personal information about you. In either case,
we're not giving the information we have from the session tracking to
anyone not related to perl.org operations.

<h4>Logs</h4>

Our web servers makes logs of most requests the receive. We use the
logs for statistical purposes (fancy way of saying "to get a kick out
of the increasing traffic") and to make the site better (like, seeing
what sections people use and what what broken links we have).
