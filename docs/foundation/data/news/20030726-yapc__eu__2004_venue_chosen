Title: YAPC::EU::2004 Venue Chosen

The YAPC Europe Committee has selected Belfast, Northern Ireland as
the location for YAPC::Europe 2004.  An excellent proposal was also
received from Copenhagen.pm, and we hope they will consider giving a
proposal for 2005.  We're looking forward to seeing you in Belfast
next year!
