<h3>Announcement of YAPC::Europe 2003 Venue</h3>
<p>The YAPC::Europe committee take great pleasure in announcing that
Paris has been chosen as the venue for the YAPC::Europe 2003
conference.</p>

<p>Philippe Bruhat and the Paris Perl Mongers team have put together a
fine case, for the next YAPC::Europe in Paris.  They are close to
deciding on a suitable venue, already have several eager sponsors in
the background, and have begun to resolve a number of the myriad other
issues which a YAPC conference demands.</p>

<p>They have, of course, our full support.</p>

<p>We wish them every success, and look forward to attending in Paris.</p>
