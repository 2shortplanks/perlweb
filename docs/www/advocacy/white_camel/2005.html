Stas Bekman has been a tireless advocate for large-scale applications
in Perl and, of course, mod_perl. He went from an occasional asker of
questions on the mod_perl list to answering many questions, and had
the forethought to write it all down, creating and maintaining the
mod_perl guide which quickly grew to over 600 pages. Recently, he made
himself available for free talks to Perl Mongers groups during a trip
covering North America, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.

Eric Cholet may be familiar to you as the technical manager of the
YAPC Europe Foundation and as co-author of A Conference Toolkit (ACT),
which has been used to administer several European YAPCs. More
importantly, though, he works behind the scenes at perl.org,
moderating the mailing lists we all use. If you've noticed the absence
of spam on a perl.org mailing list, filters help, but Eric catches
what falls through.

Andy Lester is one of the prominent voices advocating testing and
quality assurance. He has written extensively on the importance of
good testing and maintains qa.perl.org. He is also the creator and
project leader of Phalanx, which is devoted to improving tests and
test coverage of Perl and CPAN modules to maintain quality as
development continues. Phalanx encourages interaction between
programmers by having groups of developers work together to improve
test coverage on the most used CPAN modules.
