The work of The Perl Foundation includes making sure that Perl code
and documentation are free and open for all to use, and remain free
and open for all to use.  One of the many ways we do this is through
the Perl trademark.  The Perl trademark is a tool we can use to
identify Perl code, documentation, projects, and other material
originating with Perl, or licensees who agree to and follow certain
requirements.
<p>
But our responsibility is also partly the responsibility of the whole
Perl community.  By helping us protect the Perl trademark, you help us
protect the openness and integrity of the Perl language
<p>
These guidelines are intended to cover general situations, in a
general way.  Sometimes TPF may have different or additional
requirements for specific situations.

<h3>User Logos</h3>
<p>
Any individual, organization, or company may use the "Powered by Perl"
or "Programming Republic of Perl" logos to show support for Perl or as
part of a notice to users that your product or website runs on Perl.
On websites, these logos should always link to <a
href="http://www.perl.org">http://www.perl.org</a>. These logos may
not be used on product packaging or to promote products and services,
or to create the impression of an endorsement or certification by TPF.

<h3>Perl Marks for Use by TPF Organizations</h3>
<p>
The Perl logo, the Perl Foundation logo, and the bare onion logo are
available for use by Perl Mongers, Perl Monks, and Perl.org, which are
part of TPF. These Perl marks are available for use on their websites
and materials promoting Perl, TPF,  and their projects (on t-shirts,
mugs, flyers, etc.). This authorization to use the Perl logo is
limited to uses by the organizations themselves, and doesn't extend to
individual members. Representatives of the organizations should
contact us at trademark@perlfoundation.org to obtain high-resolution
versions of the Perl logo, and answers to any questions they have
about use of the logo.

<h3>Use of Perl Marks by YAPC</h3>
<p>
The affiliated YAPC conferences around the world may use the Perl logo
on their websites or materials promoting the conferences with prior
written permission from TPF. Contact trademark@perlfoundation.org for
permission, and once permission is granted, for high-resolution
versions of the Perl logo.

<h3>Perl Marks Available for Perl Redistributors</h3> 
<p>
Licensed redistributors of Perl code are permitted by their licenses
to use the Perllogo in connection with their distribution services, on
product packaging, and in promotional materials. Contact
trademark@perlfoundation.org for more information on becoming a
licensed Perl redistributor.
	
<h3>Other Uses</h3>
<p>
For any other uses, contact us at trademark@perlfoundation.org to
discuss your proposal.


<h3>Use Guidelines</h3>
<p>
Anyone who uses any Perl mark is required to comply with these use
guidelines, as well as the requirements in your license, if you are a
licensee. For special or unusual projects, we may ask you to comply
with requirements specific to your use.

<ol>
<li>Marks must always be legible and clearly reproduced.

<li>Do not incorporate any Perl marks into the marks, logos, or name
of your business, project, or organization, unless you have the prior
written permission of TPF.

<li>Marks must be used in their entirety.  Any variation in the form of 
the mark must be approved in advance in writing by TPF.

<li>A trademark symbol should follow all prominent uses of the marks.
Use the trademark symbol as shown here: 

<blockquote>
<img src="/images/perl_tm_demo.png">
</blockquote>

Certain types of projects, products and packaging may require
additional notices.  Please contact us for more information and to
discuss your intended use.

<li>A notice which identifies TPF as the mark's owner must also be
used.  For example: "The Perl logo is a trademark of the Perl
Foundation."
</ol>

<h3>Onions and the Perl Trademark</h3>
<p>
People sometimes ask if TPF's use of an onion in the Perl logo means
that independent projects that use or relate to Perl need TPF's
permission to use an onion of their own design in connection with
their project. 
<p>
The answer is "not necessarily" as long as no likelihood of confusion
is created. One of the fundamental legal bases for trademark
protection is to make sure that the public can depend on a mark as an
accurate indicator of  a particular source or relationship, and one
way of defining trademark infringement is to say that the infringing
mark creates a likelihood of confusion. Likelihood of confusion is
determined based not only on making a comparison of the marks
side-by-side, but also on making a comparison of the contexts in which
they are actually used. Thus, it's easy to imagine independent onions
that would be fine, and independent onions that might not be. Contact
us at trademark@perlfoundation.org if you have any questions, or would
like us to evaluate a particular logo or usage to see if it would be
an infringement. 

<h3>Playing your Part</h3>
<p>
The Perl marks provide a valuable service to the Perl community and
the public at large, and we are counting on you to share with us the
responsibility of protecting their integrity. Thanks for your help.
