Title: Allison Answers Questions about TPF & Pugs

Allison Randal has some answers to questions that came up at 
YAPC::NA about Pugs and where TPF stands in relation to the 
project.
---
<p><b><i>What is Pugs?</i></b></p>

<p>Pugs is a prototype compiler for Perl 6. It's currently written in 
Haskell, but is being ported to Perl 6. It's not intended to be a 
complete compiler from Perl 6 source to executable code, it's a 
compiler targeting a virtual machine: Parrot, CLR, Mono, JVM, etc. 
In fact, there's a good chance it'll target all of those.</p>

<p><b><i>What do you think about Pugs?</i></b></p>

<p>I think Pugs is incredibly cool. I remember when I first heard 
about it: Leo and Nick and I were at the German Perl Workshop. Leo 
pulled out his laptop and showed us some Perl 6 code running. I 
was so excited I immediately downloaded it and compiled GHC to 
play with it, and then used it for a demo in a talk the next week.</p>

<p><b><i>Will Pugs be the production implementation of Perl 6?</i></b></p>

<p>Autrijus has asked us not to treat Pugs as a production system. It 
may sound strange at first, but I think he's absolutely right. It 
gives the Pugs team a lot of flexibility to experiment without worrying 
about the results. It's called "R & D" in the corporate world, and is 
probably the biggest source of technological innovations in all large 
companies.</p>

<p>But will Pugs code ship in the production release of Perl 6.0? I 
don't know yet. It partly depends on the speed, robustness, and 
maintainability of the final code (which is not something the Pugs 
folks need to be thinking about right now). Whatever the relationship 
in terms of lines of code, the work being done in Pugs will certainly 
have a significant impact on the final form of the Perl 6 compiler. 
What I think is most likely is that the final compiler will be a 
synthesis of ideas between Pugs and the Parrot compiler tools. To be 
postmodern about it: the production implementation of Perl 6 both is 
and is not Pugs.</p>

<p><b><i>Pugs isn't a TPF project?</i></b></p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure what that means. There isn't much of a difference 
between "TPF projects" and "non-TPF projects". They're all groups of 
volunteers working on stuff for Perl. Pugs uses Perl.org (i.e. TPF) 
mailing lists. I suppose when you boil it down to brass tacks, all it 
really means is that the code isn't being contributed to TPF; it's 
copyright Autrijus Tang. That's okay. It means we'd have to do a 
little legal legwork to incorporate Pugs code into Perl 6, but it's 
not a big deal.</p>

<p><b><i>Would TPF consider funding Autrijus for Pugs?</i></b></p>

<p>"Absolutely. Autrijus' says his six-month sabbatical is drawing to a
close soon, and he would welcome sponsorship from TPF or other places.
TPF would also be happy to sponsor other Pugs developers. If you're
interested in sponsoring Pugs development, contact Autrijus directly,
or contact allison {at} perl {dot} org."</p>
