=head1 Simple DirectMedia Library Bindings for Perl

Welcome to the new SDL Perl pages, graciously hosted by Perl.org.

=head2 Latest News

B<5 October 2005>: 2.1.3 released!

Dave has returned, integrating several important and useful changes into SDL
Perl version 2.1.x, including the new build system.  See
L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/SDL_Perl/>.  Please report any strange behavior
to the list.

=head2 Tutorials Online!

We've written four tutorials so far, and you can read them online:

=over 4

=item SDL::Tutorial at L<http://sdl.perl.org/tutorials/>

=item SDL::Tutorial::Drawing at L<http://sdl.perl.org/tutorials/drawing.html>

=item SDL::Tutorial::Animation at L<http://sdl.perl.org/tutorials/animation.html>

Animation basics.

=item SDL::Tutorial::Images at L<http://sdl.perl.org/tutorials/images.html>

Image loading and animation.

Of course, if you grab a snapshot and install it, not only can you report
successes (and probably a few bugs), but you can play with the demo program for
each tutorial!  It's very fun.

=head2 A Little History

Why are these pages new?  In October, David GE<ouml>hrig, the creator and
maintainer of SDL Perl, announced that he was quitting his job, selling all his
stuff, and going backpacking in Europe for a few months.  That left SDL Perl
without a maintainer or a home.

=head2 Future Plans

We're working on polishing the latest code available to make the 1.20.4
release, as the newest version on the CPAN is rather old.  Then, it's
miscellaneous cleanups, more documentation and tutorials, bugfixes, and new
features.

Hopefully, Perl will soon be a wonderful language in which to write media
applications -- including games.

We'll be making archives of the old mailing list available.  Subscribe to the
