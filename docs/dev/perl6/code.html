<h4>
    What's Parrot
</h4>
<p>
    Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although we would like to keep the door open for other languages in the future. As such, Parrot will be the core of the Perl interpreter; it will be the target platform to which Perl 6 code is compiled.
</p>
<h4>
    Where are we
</h4>
<p>
    Parrot source code was released to the world on Monday 10th of September 2001; since then, an army of developers have furiously been hacking away on it. Currently, we have a virtual machine to execute bytecode, an intermediate and an assembly language, a definition for abstract syntax trees, and compilers that translate these three representations to byte code.
</p>
<p>
    A just-in-time compiler and a garbage collector are implemented.
</p>
<p>
    There's a Perl 6 compiler being worked on, <a href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo</a>, which implements variables, control flow statements, operators, basic multi method dispatch and basic classes and objects.
</p>
<h4>
    How to get the code
</h4>
<p>
    Each month a new version is released. The current version is 0.9.1, and can be found on <a href="http://www.parrot.org/download">the parrot hompage</a>
</p>
<p>
    For the very latest version of Parrot, check out the source from <a href="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk">SVN</a>. There is anonymous access to all, and commit access to those who have taken responsibility for various areas of the code or produced a large number of high-quality patches.
