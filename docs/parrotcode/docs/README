This file isn't linked to, and is just to document how this directory is laid
out.

All .pod files in the docs directory are referenced here, cached for a day.

If a new file is added to the repository, then you must explicitly add it here.

Some of the docs files (like glossary) already existed in a different location
on parrotcode.org and are not duplicated here. (Though they should be moved
here in in a future release.)

Additionally, some files that are used to create .pod docs in the docs dir
during a build are reference here - the pod2html converter used by the web
site automatically extracts the pod for display. (This lets us skip the build
step for the website.)
