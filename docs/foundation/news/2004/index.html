<h2>July 20, 2004<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2004/yapcna2005cfv.html">YAPC::NA::2005 Call For Venues</a></h2>
<p>It's time to throw open the call for venues for next year's 
<a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC::NA</a>.</p>

<p>You can get details on what YAPCs entail at 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. 
When making your proposal, in addition to venue information and dates, do 
please make sure to include details on airport locations, local public 
transit (as well as transit to the venue from the airport!), local cultural 
attractions, and accommodation information. (See the docs for more details)
The more information you provide, within reason, the better.</p>

<p>This year we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a HREF="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a> 
for more information on this.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are 
due by Friday, August 31 2004, with a decision due on September 15 2004. 
(If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may extend the 
deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks, which is short but
manageable, and should still fit within most college and university scheduling 
requirements.</p>

<p>You can watch the <a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC.org</a> home page for any
more info or changes."</p>

<h2>June 28, 2004<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2004/yapceu2005cfv.html">Call for Venue "YAPC::Europe::2005"</a></h2>
<p>European YAPC's and National Workshops now have a foundation.</p>

<p>The main goal of the newly formed YAPC Europe Foundation is to provide
assistance on request to any European crew setting up a conference (be
it a YAPC::Europe or a national workshop).</p>

<p>The foundation can bring help in terms of experience from previous
organisers, resources: web space, CVS, mailing lists... (online
payment will also be offered), etc.</p>

<p>Of course, its chief concern is to make sure there is a yearly
YAPC::Europe, and while the Belfast Perl mongers are organizing the
YAPC::Europe::2004 conference in Northern Ireland with enthusiasm, YEF
is already looking for next years candidates.</p>

<p>Any dedicated crew interested in organizing the YAPC::Europe
conference in 2005 should send an informal application, stating their
interest, to:</p>

<p>"YAPC::Europe conference proposal" committee@yapceurope.org</p>

<p>Questions about the application and help to present it can also be
asked at this same address.</p>

<p>Deadline for applications: August 15th 2004</p>

<p>For general information about the venue requirements, check the
YAPC::Venue module on CPAN, and look at the previous venues at:</p>
