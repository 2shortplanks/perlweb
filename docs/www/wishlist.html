<H3>Wishlist</H3>

<ul>

<li>1U or 2U servers, preferably i386 or AMD64 for our <a
href="http://noc.perl.org/">various services</a> (web, email, revision
control, ...).  At least 8GB ram and room for two or more disks (we
have all our system disks mirrored).</li>

<li>Sometimes large SATA disks</li> 

<!--
<li>1U or 2U servers, in particular non-i386 ones (Alpha, Opteron,
...) for setting up smoke testing of perl5 and parrot.
-->

<li>Servers in Asia for mirroring search.cpan.org, perldoc.perl.org
and related services (we're well covered in North America and have a
server in London, too).  Can be virtual or real hardware, but needs to
run RHEL (we can provide media and license) and have 4GB ram or more.
</li>

<li>Managed Gigabit Switch (~24 ports).  We have an old Dell one, but
if someone has a spare HP or Cisco quality one...</li>
 
<li>An industrial strength NAS - NetAPP or EMC or similar.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you have some other useful spare hardware or can help in another
way, email webmaster at perl.org and we'll see if we can make use of
it.</p>
