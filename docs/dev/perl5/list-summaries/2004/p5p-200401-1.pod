=head1 This Week on perl5-porters (29 December 2003 / 4 January 2004)

At the turn of the year, and in accordance with the grand schedule of
things, occurred a code freeze for perl 5.8.3.  Read below for the rest of
the discussion that took place on perl5-porters.

=head2 Cloning in XS

Stas Bekman is writing a working demo implementation of the CLONE()
function, for people who want to write multithread-friendly XS modules,
without overlooking any case.  Jan Dubois suggests that F<h2xs> should
know about CLONE() and insert the appropriate boilerplates; because
currently the amount of code necessary to make an XS implementation of
CLONE() work is too big.

Also related to cloning, but more general (as it affects pure-perl code),
is bug #24383 : during cloning, hashes with the C<:unique> attribute
weren't made readonly on the interpreter clone.  This was fixed by Dave
Mitchell.

=head2 XS leaks when returning AVs/HVs

Marcus Holland-Moritz suspects that the code generated by F<xsubpp> to
return arrays and hashes from XS subroutines is potentially leaking
memory.  As some modules on CPAN appear to work around this, it's already
too late to change it -- but this should be documented.

=head2 unpack() and UTF-8

While discussing bug #24767 -- a pack()/unpack() combination that's
apparently not idempotent -- Wolfgang Laun asks the question : should
unpack() warn when certain unpack codes are applied to an UTF-8 input?
This needs further thinking.

=head2 Modules upgraded

Johan Vromans released Getopt::Long 2.34_01, introducing a new
experimental feature : options with more than one value.

Dan Kogai released Encode 1.99, a bug-fix release.  Tels released
Math::Bigint 1.68.  Andy Lester released Test::Harness 2.40.  Ken Williams
released Cwd 2.13.

=head2 In Brief

By doing some benchmarking, Marcus Holland-Moritz reaches the conclusion
that using the optimization level C<-O3> on Linux with gcc is not worth
it.  He suggests to default to C<-O2> instead.

Craig Berry posted a status of maintperl on VMS.  Several thinks need
fixing, including MakeMaker (for which he provided a patch); but maybe
Nicholas will decide to release perl 5.8.3 with the same version of
MakeMaker that shipped with 5.8.2.
