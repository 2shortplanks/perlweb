<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 
projects funded</a>. This is the eighth in a series of informal interviews 
finding out more information about these projects. Up now is 
Curtis Hall with "Refactor Pirate so that the intermediate code emitter 
is independent of the Python parse tree (AST)".</p>
<p><b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br>
I'm 23, a senior at the University of Arizona in Tucson and working towards
degrees in Computer Science and Anatomy and Physiology. I'm minoring in
Italian and Psychology. I was born on a military base in Vicenza, Italy 
where my dad was stationed.</p>

<p><b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br>
I will be refactoring <a href="http://pirate.tangentcode.com/">Pirate</a> 
so that it becomes more of a generic compiler system. The goal is to 
separate the parser from the IMC emitter so that it can become somewhat of 
a template compiler for other scripting languages that want to be ported 
to Parrot.  Upon completion of this, I plan on implementing new language
constructs that Pirate lacks.</p>

<p><b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br>
The Virtual Machine Parrot has interested me since first hearing
about it, and the idea of compiling and running several languages on 
one virtual machine spun me in the direction of Pirate.</p>

<p><b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br>
Upon completion of this project, I would like to begin porting the Icon
programming language to Parrot, using the generalized routines I've
implemented and creating new ones that are specific to Icon.</p>

<p><b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?  
Got a blog?</b><br>
With this type of Project, a very large portion of time will be devoted 
to theory and understanding of the code that is already in place and in
use. It is important to understand the functionality of everything as 
it is working now, and work towards improving that functionality 
before actually modifying or adding any code. As of now no code has 
been modified, but all that is will be documented and tracked over 
the next few months.</p>

<p><b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br>
No, I underestimated the importance of this project to computer science
world, and therefore thought that it would be over looked.</p>

<p><b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?</b><br>
I'm actually still a CS minor trying to fulfill the CS major 
requirements<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:-)</p>
