<h1>Parrot 0.3.1 "Wart" Released!</h1>

November 6, 2005<br><br>

<p>On behalf of the Parrot team I'm proud to announce the release of
Parrot 0.3.1 and I'd like to thank all involved people as well as our
sponsors for supporting us.</p>

<h2>What is Parrot?</h2>

<p>Parrot is a virtual machine aimed at running Perl6 and other dynamic
languages.</p>

<h2>Parrot 0.3.1 changes and news</h2>

<ul>
<li> Variable sized register frames are finished. Each subroutine gets
  the amount of registers that it actually needs. No more spilling.
<li> Vastly improved PGE (Parrot Grammar Engine) including shift-reduce,
  precedence-based expression parser and support for matching of
  bracketed text delimited by e.g. ()[]{}'"
<li> uniccode character classification (is_upper ...)
<li> support for heredoc syntax in assembler
<li> improved examples, basic JSON support
<li> debian packaging support
<li> the usual improvements, bug fixes, and cleanup
<li> test count exceeds 3000

</ul>
