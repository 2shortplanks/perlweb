<h2>April 21, 2006<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2006/artistic_license_review.html">Artistic License 2.0 public review</a></h2>
Part of the Perl 6 RFC process in 2000 identified the need to update the
Artistic Licence (RFCs <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/rfc/211.html">211</a> and <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/rfc/346.html">346</a>). From 2000-2001, a group of interested Perl users on the <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.licenses/">perl6-licenses mailing list</a> worked on a first draft of an updated Artistic License. In 2003, The Perl Foundation started an extensive review process with independent legal counsel and with a representative sample of companies and organizations who use and distribute Perl. We're starting the final stage now: a public review open to all.
<p>
The goal of the license update is to preserve Larry Wall's original intent, while making the meaning clearer both to lawyers and to users. We've also added a Contributor License Agreement to document the relationship between contributors, users, and TPF. You'll find the latest drafts of the Artistic 2.0 and the Contributor License Agreement in the <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/legal/">legal section of the TPF website</a>.
<p>
If you have any questions or comments, or just want to follow the conversation, please subscribe to the mailing list by sending a message to artistic2-subscribe {at} perl {dot} org.
<p>
After 5 years of work, we're excited to reach this point. Thanks to everyone who contributed along the way!
