Title:  Summer of Code: Perl "Megadistro"

<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's 
<a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> 
program and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. 
This is the third in a series of informal interviews finding out more information 
about these projects. Up now is David Buchman  with "Perl Megadistro".</p>

<p><b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br>
I am currently 20 years old, and am currently a student at Middlesex County College, 
in New Jersey.  I am currently studying Computer Science, in a degree program -- 
I have been interested in computer-related courses for some time, both hardware 
and software related -- additionally, I am interested in network administration.
I am also a big supporter of open source projects, and appreciate all the work 
that the community has done thus far, in a multitude of aspects.</p>

<p><b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b> <br>
I will be creating a megadistro, so to speak, of Perl, which will encapsulate 
lots of useful modules (essential and additional) -- after which, I will 
create Makefile to build the install -- finally,  after testing the install, 
ensuring that everything passes `make test`, I will package it.  The intent 
for the final product, will be a nice and thorough package, of perl, built 
for each and every major distro.</p>

<p><b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b> <br>
I was quite interested in developing a project for the SoC (Google - 
Summer of Code 2005), namely with TPF (The Perl Foundation). This past 
semester I had just completed a course in perl, and became quite interested 
in the language; moreover, this past semester, I was busily developing my own, 
personal projects, some of which utilized perl and many perl modules.  After 
trying to think of a feasible project to develop for TPF, I thought of this 
as the best project, in which I could benefit TPF, as well as, the community, 
as I had recently experienced the complexities and complications that can go 
into installing perl and many modules, which I needed to acquire and install 
(when working on personal projects, using perl).</p>

<p><b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b> <br>
Honestly, I have not really sought past this summer, as much work awaits, but 
hopefully, this project will be continually built on; the Makefile updated 
appropriately, more modules added here and there, repackage, and redistribute<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;)</p>

<p><b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?  Got a blog?</b> <br>
Although, at the moment, I had no plans with regard to that aspect, I will 
try to get some sort of page up, which will track my continual work on 
this project -- personally, I am not one to blog, anything -- I am more 
typically accustomed to the developer and commit e-mail lists.</p>

<p><b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br>
Honestly, I really didn't have any expectations as towards whether or not I
would get funded; I merely entertained the idea that I would be working on 
a project for TPF.  Though I have experience with open source projects, and 
had the opportunity to take courses related to some of the material I 
actually work on, whether it be perl or another area, I did not think 
that it would give me a better shot at getting my project funded over that 
of any other ambitious student.  However, now that my project is funded, I 
eagerly await the mountain of work that lies ahead<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)</p>

<p><b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?</b><br>
As for myself, nothing comes to mind, presently -- though if there any 
developments on that front, I'll make sure to let the 
community know<nobr> <wbr></nobr>;) With regards to the project, I cannot 
think of anything particularly silly,... yet -- check back with me in a 
week or two, I'm sure we'll have much to talk about then.</p>
