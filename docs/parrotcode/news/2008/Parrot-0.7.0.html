<p>On behalf of the Parrot team, I'm proud to announce Parrot 0.7.0
&quot;Severe Macaw.&quot; <a href="http://parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>
is a virtual machine aimed at running all dynamic languages.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.7.0 is available via <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/parrot">CPAN</a> (soon), or <a
href="http://parrotcode.org/source.html">follow the download
instructions</a>.  For those who would like to develop on Parrot, or
help develop Parrot itself, we recommend using <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> on <a
href="https://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk/">our source code repository</a>
to get the latest and best Parrot code.</p>

<p>Parrot 0.7.0 Highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li> The new concurrency implementation makes its debut in 0.7.0.  See
       http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/pdd/pdd25_concurrency.html for more.

  <li> Rakudo (Perl 6) now supports class attributes and multiple dispatch,
       plus some metaclass support, among others.
</ul>
