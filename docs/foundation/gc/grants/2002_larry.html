<p>
Larry Wall is the creator of Perl. He has also authored several other
popular free programs available for Unix, including the <i>rn</i>
newsreader and the ubiquitous <i>patch</i> program. By training Larry
is a linguist who has a fondness for Hobbits. Larry is the keystone of
the Perl 6 design team and funding his work writing the design
documents (or as he whimsically refers to them: the "Apocalypses") has
permitted development to advance swiftly. We will continue to
facilitate the Perl 6 design and development as funding allows. The
Foundation is indebted to Larry for his tireless work on the difficult
task of designing the language, and to the many contributors who have
supported this effort with RFCs, feedback and contributions to TPF.
