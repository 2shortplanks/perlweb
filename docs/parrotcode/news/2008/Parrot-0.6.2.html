<h1>Parrot 0.6.2 &quot;Reverse Sublimation&quot; Released</h1>

<p>20 May 2008</p>

<blockquote><p>They were walking to the Hemlock, the Rooster and the Mice, and
the Mice kept looking at one another, questioning.</p>

<p>"We don't know what the future holds, do we?" said Chauntecleer.  The Mice
all shook their heads.  They knew very little of anything.  "If," said
Chauntecleer, "I say, <em>if</em> I don't come back again, then you must make
this food to last a long, long time.  I trust your prudence, don't I?" he
asked, and they nodded automatically, but their eyes were very big.  "And I
trust your integrity, right?"  They nodded.  "And you are mature, now, and I
respect your maturity, isn't that so?"  Poor Mice, they nodded and nodded, and
they blinked, and they nodded.  They looked afraid.  "Good," said Chauntecleer.
"I know I won't be disappointed.</p>

<p>In this way he gave each Mouse a manhood.  They couldn't talk to him just
now, having so much to turn over in their minds.  But neither did they
cry.</p></blockquote>
