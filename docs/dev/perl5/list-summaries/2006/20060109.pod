=head1 This Week on perl5-porters - 9-15 January 2006

Now 5.8.8 is closer and porters give the final touches and
wait on smoke signs. Issues in blead are being worked out,
preparing for 5.9.3 as well.

=head2 Cygwin C<Configure> Fix


H. Merijn Brand applied one between two candidate patches
by Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes to fix B<Configure> on
Cygwin.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00459.html

=head2 Dual-life C<threads::shared>


The last summary mentioned how Dave Mitchell's work on threads
and shared variables improved speed while also closing
RT ticket #37946. Nicholas Clark suggested the changes were packaged
into a CPAN module, allowing people to try it without
the need to hastily release the changes with 5.8.8.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00388.html

=head2 Less code to C<warn>


Nicholas Clark did (in change #26787)
a refactoring on C<S_vdie_common> so that C<Perl_vwarn> can use it too.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00496.html

=head2 Locating/Fixing Regex Engine Bugs


About ticket #38133 on a bug with quantified
groups, Hugo van der Sanden layed out the process to fix a bug in the scary
regex engine, followed by the conclusion that it must
be a while until someone skilled find the time
to initiate the process.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00336.html

=head2 One List for All Arenas


In response to Jim Cromie reposting the patch to
unify all arenas, Nicholas Clark suggested to
wait until after 5.9.3 but Rafael Garcia-Suarez has
the ultimate word.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00395.html

=head2 F<perl593delta> Review Continued


For F<perl593delta> review, Nicholas Clark reminded the Sadahiro
Tomoyuki's XS-assisted C<swashget> and Steve Hay followed
with a list of the stuff he was involved in.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00520.html

=head2 Towards 5.9.3


Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes made
a little change to F<t/TEST> to get rid of some 'FAILED--unexpected ouput'.

    relaxing TEST restrictions
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00344.html

Gisle Aas, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Yitzchak and Jim Cromie went
on discussing how to identify compiled snapshots versus releases.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00370.html

=head2 Squashing Format Warnings


Jarkko Hietaniemi posted a patch to silence some
format warnings in blead seen in Tru64 and due to certain
assumptions about types and appropriate formats.
Gisle Aas and Robin Barker had some comments about it.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00277.html

=head2 B<mod_perl> 2 broken


Philip M. Gollucci wrote to say building B<mod_perl> 2
against blead on FreeBSD does not work since August.
Prodded by Stas Bekman, Philip produced a small program
to reproduce the issue, which Stas thought Philip could
reduce even more using his familiarity with B<mod_perl>
code.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00288.html


Philip M. Gollucci forwarded a workaround to build
MP2 on alpha platform from the modperl dev list.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00334.html

=head2 Syncing C<Pod::Simple>


Allison Randal called for a diff of all the changes
that made into the core version of C<Pod::Simple>
and this week she sync'ed the CPAN version, reaching release 3.04.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00461.html

=head2 3-argument C<open> and IO Layers


Answering ticket #38181, Sadahiro Tomoyuki noticed
the issue with default IO layers ignored in 3-argument C<open>
calls was recently resolved in blead and sent a
patch to assure the C<-C> switch was mentioned
in related docs.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00302.html

=head2 More about F<embed.fnc>


Jim Cromie added a few more lines to improve
info about F<embed.fnc> in F<pod/perlguts.pod>.
Applied as change #26756.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00313.html

=head2 C<POSIX> vs C<Fcntl>


Andreas Koenig reported what he thought to
be unexpected warnings when requiring F<Expect.pm>.
Nicholas Clark answered that the "redefined"
warnings were correct, as constant subroutines
were redefined indeed. But it was not due to
C<Expect> but rather to C<POSIX> and C<Fcntl> exporting
subroutines with the same name.
Nicholas proposed a patch so that C<POSIX> use C<Fcntl>
to get the common values. Rafael Garcia-Suarez thought
it looked good as it ended an error that puzzled many
developers, even though it adds to C<POSIX> a dependency,
which appears to be harmless.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00326.html

=head2 I<maint> on VMS


Abe Timmerman brought the results of tests againts
maint@26746 on VMS, which succeeds in 98.79% of
test scripts.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00327.html

=head2 threads + C<require IO>


Dave Mitchell commented on ticket #37076 about
segfaults by mixing threads and C<require IO>.
The guilty part is C<newCONSTSUB()> which isn't threadsafe.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00329.html

=head2 Stalled B<perlcc>


Glancing at tickets #37488 and #37491
about bugs in B<perlcc>, Dave Mitchel advised that this is no longer actively
maintained, which means bugs are unlikely to be fixed.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00330.html
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00331.html

=head2 Empty Strings as C<select> Bitmasks


Nicholas Clark confirmed the patch by Gisle Aas
to allow C<""> as select bitmasks is in perl-5.8.8.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00347.html

=head2 Where is F<Digest/SHA.pm>?


Jim Cromie noticed a failure to locate F<Digest/SHA.pm>
after resync'ing, which suggested problems in change 26704
which added SHA-256 support for CPAN. It turned out
to be fixed by running B<Configure> again, but Yitzchak
Scott-Thoennes reminded new extensions need to be manually
added to the win32 makefiles for C<distclean> to work right.
Rafael Garcia-Suarez committed change #26758 to solve this
case.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00351.html

=head2 Agnostic C<Compress::Zlib>


Paul Marquess brought in a major patch of C<Compresss::Zlib>
against blead, with the previously announced rewrite
to support other compression formats. Porters agreed that,
as 5.9.3 will wait until 5.8.8 and blead issues are worked out,
C<C::Z> would probably get enough days of smoke.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00377.html

=head2 I<maint> snapshot


Nicholas Clark did a lot more patch integration stuff and made a maint
snapshot C<perl@26746>.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00380.html

=head2 F<perlhack.pod> and C<POPSTACK>


Jan Dubois noted the little bit about C<POPSTACK>
in F<perlhack.pod> is wrong and  called for someone
qualified to write a description about the "stack of stacks"
concept.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00382.html

=head2 C<Sys::Syslog> 0.12 and 0.13


After Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni announced C<Sys::Sylog>
reached release 0.12, Alan Burlison noticed it was broken on
Solaris and other platforms. Alan, Rafael Garcia-Suarez,
Nicholas Clark and Gisle Aas investigated and patched
the issues. Sébastien merged the changes back to CPAN version
and released 0.13

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00261.html

=head2 Andy Lester's Stuff


As a compliment to his daughter's purple Barbie bus,
Andy Lester coined a name for his last patch on his
continued effort to improve code with regard to
correctness and cleanliness.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00386.html

Andy also inquired why this kind of code is used throughout

    if (ckWARN(WARN_MISC))
        Perl_warner(aTHX_ packWARN(WARN_MISC), WARNING_MESSAGE);

instead of something like

     Perl_warn_maybe( aTHX_ WARN_MISC, WARNING_MESSAGE );

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00471.html

=head2 Who wants C<setlocale(LC_ALL,"")>?


Andrew Dunstan opened RT ticket #38193 to tell how
an embedded perl interpreter always starts by calling
C<setlocale(LC_ALL,"")>. But that's not an all-satisfying
solution for every application and he called for a way
to give more flexibility to avoid unintented effects
on character data.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00389.html

=head2 C<$0> Assignment when Embedding


Gisle Aas noticed that, when embedding perl, the default
behaviour of C<$0> assignments writing to the memory of
C<argv[0]> and calling C<setproctitle()> is hardly the
expected action. It can cause segfaults and hide the
host application from B<ps> for example. Gisle posted
a patch to allow disabling such behavior and is still
waiting for comments.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00391.html

=head2 A Constant Challenge


Dave Mitchell pointed consting work waiting to be done is
changing C<C?OP*> usage to C<const C?OP*>, to prevent
code which messes with the fields of an OP. OPs are shared
between threads which makes a bad idea to fuss around
with them.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00398.html

=head2 Perl on HP-UX 11.23


H. Merijn Brand spent some time preparing a rx1620 dual Itanium
to see what Perl builds are looking like in such architecture.
Merijn discovered that, to use HP C-ANSI-C compiler, one
needs to drop optimizing to -O1 for a range of this compiler
family  on HP-UX 11.23.
All tests passed on both perl-5.8.x-dor:26763 and perl-current:26768,
32 and 64bit, but not threads. Next step is smokes on this box.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00412.html

=head2 coderefs in regexes


Yves Orton wanted to know how to get access to code refs
embedded in regexes, so he could teach C<Data::Dump::Streamer>
to dump them out correctly. Dave Mitchell revealed coderefs
in regexes are some sort of abomination more like evals
than proper closures. There is a plan to get them right, but not yet.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00423.html

=head2 C<version> 0.53


John Peacock uploaded C<version> 0.53 to CPAN and brought
the corresponding patch to bleed.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00439.html

=head2 Bad Locales on Mac OS X


Dominic Dunlop found that the release of Mac OS X 10.4.4
still has broken Catalan locales, which defeated the
optimistical assumption that the problem would be fixed
by now, and posted a patch to skip the bad locales once again.

    Bad locales in Sep 2005
    http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20050915.html#OS_X_10.4_Issues
    Bad locales in Nov 2005

    Bad locales enter 2006
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00452.html

=head2 Fix for C<:crlf>


Xavier Noria noticed the C<:crlf> layer in PerlIO was not
portable as suggested in its documentation when it comes
to support Mac text files conventions and proposed a patch
to fix this (applied as change 26796).

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00462.html

=head2 One less Typo in F<perlfaq8>


On bug #38205, erik noticed a typo at F<perlfaq8>,
promptly patched as change #26802 in blead.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00467.html

=head2 cloning and C<foo_dup> functions


Looking at the cloning code at F<perlio.c>, Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
found a spot in C<*_dup> functions which was probably wrong
and suggested a fix, seconded by Gisle Aas and Rafael Garcia-Suarez
which applied it as change #26799.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00469.html

=head2 C<PERL_UNUSED_DECL> redefined


While building C<Digest::SHA>, Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes
noticed a warning about redefining C<PERL_UNUSED_DECL>.
It was fixed by copying a newer F<ppport.h>
(any of the 3 others under F<ext/>), which remembered
Rafael Garcia-Suarez of an old idea to compile C<Devel::PPPort>
first and use its F<ppport.h> everywhere.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00470.html

=head2 Broken C<local($[) = 0>


In RT ticket #38207, David Dyck reported a "Useless localization of constant"
in F<getopts.pl>: C<local($[) = 0;>, that led Rafael Garcia-Suarez
to the conclusion that something changed in blead that broke
the special case handling of C<local $[> supported for perl 4 compatibility.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00475.html

=head2 C<Compress::Zlib> Fights Smokes


And Paul Marquess brought another fix to C<Compress::Zlib>
trying to shut up an intermittent failure which keeps showing up on the smokes.
Applied as change #26800.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00484.html

=head2 C<DB_File> and Berkeley DB 4.4


Jeff Earickson opened ticket #38213 to say about a failure
testing C<DB_File> against Berkeley DB 4.4.16.
Paul Marquess explained 5.8.8 already allows C<DB_File> to build
with db 4.4 and the the most recent CPAN version had this support.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00490.html

=head2 pack/unpack for struct flock


Brendan O'Dea noticed how tricky is to portably use C<Fcntl> locking
and proposed a patch with a function to pack/unpack C<flock>
structures. Warnocked so far.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00491.html

=head2 David Landgren Fights Indirect Notation


This week, David Landgren started a crusade to remove
indirect notation examples from POD all over the core
modules. He started with C<IO::File> and C<IO::??>
While on this, Jim Cromie had suggestions for some
improvements/additions to docs, which were absorbed.
chromatic welcomed David's campaign.
And then, David went on to apply this to
C<IO::Pipe> and C<IO::Handle> together with some sundry cleanups.

The no-indirect-notation campaign boils down to this: instead of writing

    $fh = new IO::File;

which is considered bad practice in some circles, the
following is preferrable:

    $fh = IO::File->new;

    David Landgren tidies up IO::* modules
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00494.html

=head2 saving the regexp state


Nicholas Clark wondered about a piece code in F<Perl_save_re_context>
and brainstormed on how to make saving/restoring regexp
states with less computational effort. Hugo van der Sanden
and Abhijit Menon-Sen essayed some clues.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00495.html

=head2 Dual life module versions


Nicholas Clark did a check to find dual-life modules which differ
between maint and 5.8.7, but have the same version. This prompted
Marcus Holland-Moritz to explain about C<Devel::PPPort> releases,
which led Nicholas to integrate 3.06_01 to blead. Jan Dubois also
explained about the status of C<Win32> and some plans
for future releases.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00503.html

=head2 Perl on MPE/iX


Ken Hirsch brought some patches which I<only> affect MPE/iX
platform.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00504.html

=head2 C<B::Deparse> Chokes in 5.8.0


Lionel Cons, in bug #38214, showed how perl 5.8.0 dislikes a
simple assignment with split via C<B::Deparse>.

    $ perl -MO=Deparse -e '@ARGV = split(//, "");'
    Can't call method "isa" without a package ...

Joshua ben Jore and Paul Johnson helped Lionel to find this is
a bug with 5.8.0-threads and that upgrading is the key.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00507.html

=head2 Linux Issue about C<ioctl>


Charles Howes opened ticket #38223 to tell of a memory corruption
error on a formerly valid code using C<ioctl> after a Linux core upgrade.
Gisle Aas tracked it down to change #25852 and a probable glibc issue
with C<_IOC_SIZE>, which called for a fix anyway.

    Trusting _IOC_SIZE (Oct 2005)

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00535.html

=head2 Threads and PIDs on Linux


Nicholas Clark tried to remember some binary compatibility
issues with threads and PIDs on Linux due to a change made some time ago.
Jason Vas Dias and Elizabeth Mattijsen know what it was about. Rafael
Garcia-Suarez said the CPAN module C<Linux::PID> had the
necessary workarounds.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00549.html

=head2 Deprecated C<my $v if 0>


And "fany" opened yet another ticket, #38224, about the weird deprecated usage of
C<my $foo if 0>. Not that he should have known, but this is almost a FAQ by now.

    http://dev.perl.org/perl5/list-summaries/2005/20050926.html#Deprecated_my_$v_if_0
    Ticket #38224

=head2 Perl 5.8.8's perldelta


The list of significant changes in Perl 5.8.8, F<perldelta>
evolved since its first draft posted by Nicholas through
lots of feedback.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00572.html

=head2 C<CPAN> 1.83_55


CPAN reached 1.83_55 and Andreas Koenig resynced it
into bleadperl, as change #26858.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00593.html


=head2 Updated F<README.macosx>


A bunch of MacOSX-wise people contributed
for the update of F<README.macosx>.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00598.html

=head2 C<Encode> 2.14


Dan Kogai brought C<Encode> release 2.14 into blead.

    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-01/msg00600.html

=head2 size of perl


Nicholas Clark compared the size of perl binaries between 5.9.2 and
blead, with the late being the actual winner. Despite several
new features, the  space optimizing efforts of porters,
especially Nicholas, Dave Mitchell,
Steve Peters and Andy Lester, outdid them. The same outcome is
expected with respect to 5.8.8 against 5.8.7.
