<h2>Perl Quality Assurance Projects</h2>

<p>
There are multiple projects in the Perl community related to
<ul>
    <li>improving and testing the quality and portability of Perl modules and Perl itself, and
    <li>using Perl's QA tools for general software development. 
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Testing Modules</h3>

The CPAN has a wide variety of modules to help with your automated
testing.  Here's a <A HREF="test-modules.html">summary of what's
available</A>.
<P>
Ian Langworth has put together a tremendous
<A HREF="http://langworth.com/downloads/perl_test_refcard.pdf">Perl testing quick reference card</A> that
gives usage summaries of many of the most useful modules.

<h3>Phalanx</h3> Join the team to help improve tests and documentation
for Perl and the CPAN.  It's a big step on the way to Ponie and Perl 6.
It's <A HREF="/phalanx/">the Phalanx project</A>.

<h3>Perl-QA</h3>
<p>
The <a href="mailto:perl-qa-subscribe@perl.org">perl-qa</a> mailing list is the
general discussion list for the QA of Perl, and of using Perl for QA.
(<a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.qa">Web archive</a>)

There is also a 
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~schwern/cgi-bin/perl-qa-wiki.cgi">Perl-QA wiki</A>
available.
  

</p>

<h3>Daily Build</h3>

<p>
The "smokers" do
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/smoke-test.html">smoke
tests</a> of the bleading edge Perl on various platforms to help the
developers spot new bugs as fast as possible.

and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Smoke/FAQ">smoke
FAQ</a>
for information on that.

<h3>CPAN testers</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">cpan-testers</a> is a group that
tests as many of the distributions on CPAN on as many different
platforms as possible.  It was started by Graham Barr and Chris Nandor.

<h3>Automated testing with Perl</h3>
Automated testing is a key part of software development, especially in environments
that have embraced extreme programming.
Perl's
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Harness/">Test::Harness</A> framework,
along with
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Simple/">Test::Simple and Test::More</A>,
allow flexible testing of all parts of your development projects.
