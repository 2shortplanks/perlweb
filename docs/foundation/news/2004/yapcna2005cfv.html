[% page.title = page.banner %]

<p>It's time to throw open the call for venues for next year's 
<a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC::NA</a>.</p>

<p>You can get details on what YAPCs entail at 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. 
When making your proposal, in addition to venue information and dates, do 
please make sure to include details on airport locations, local public 
transit (as well as transit to the venue from the airport!), local cultural 
attractions, and accommodation information. (See the docs for more details)
The more information you provide, within reason, the better.</p>

<p>This year we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a HREF="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a> 
for more information on this.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are 
due by Friday, August 31 2004, with a decision due on September 15 2004. 
(If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may extend the 
deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about 7 weeks, which is short but
manageable, and should still fit within most college and university scheduling 
requirements.</p>

<p>You can watch the <a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC.org</a> home page for any
more info or changes."</p>
