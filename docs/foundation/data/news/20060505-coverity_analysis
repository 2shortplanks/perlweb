Title: Coverity confirms success of Perl's testing strategy

<p>
A recent study of open source software by <a
href="http://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity, Inc</a>
showed that Perl's quality is impressively free
of bugs and defects.  Ben Chelf, Coverity's CTO,
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/stats/article.php/3589361">commented
that</a> "of the LAMP stack, Perl had the best defect density, well past
standard deviation and better than the average."

<p>
Perl's extensive quality control process, which uses over 160,000
individual cases, tested nightly on dozens of architectures and operating
systems as well as every time a user compiles Perl from source, is key
to its success.
</p>

<p>
Although Coverity's static source code analysis indicated a small number
of potential glitches in Perl's half-million lines of code, the core
development team quickly solved them.  At the same time, at least one
bug in Perl reported by Coverity's Prevent product was actually a bug
in Prevent.  However, as Nicholas Clark notes, "Coverity found bugs that
had escaped the detection of earlier tools used to refine the Perl source
code, tools such as Purify, The Third Degree and Valgrind."
</p>

<p>
Andy Lester of the Perl Foundation said, "As a core Perl developer,
I'm glad to have Coverity working with us on quality.  As a Perl fan,
I'm glad to see Coverity get the word out about my favorite language."
</p>

<p>
The fixes suggested by Coverity will be included in the forthcoming
5.10 stable release of Perl and are already available in the development
5.9 branch.  Many fixes will also be backported to the 5.8 series.
