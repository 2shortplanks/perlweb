[% page.title = "Getting and Working With the Perl Source" %]


<p>
The Perl source code is kept in a <a
href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce</a> repository.  Generally,
only the developers with <b>write</b> access to the repository access
it via the Perforce tools.
</p>

<p>
If you want to get a copy of the latest Perl source code, the easiest
way to do this is to use <i>rsync</i>:</p>

<pre>
rsync -avz rsync://ftp.linux.activestate.com/perl-current/ .
</pre>

<p>
This will pull down a copy of the latest bleadperl into your current
directory.
</p>

<p>
If you'd simply like to browse changes online, you can use the <a
href="http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse">Perl Repository Browser</a>.
</p>

<p>
You may also find the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Repository-APC/">Perl::Repository::APC</a>
module, and the scripts it comes with, helpful when working on the Perl source code.
</a>

<p>
Chia-liang Kao has developed a distributed version control system
called <a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">SVK</a>, which allows one to
mirror remote repositories locally and then work with them using
standard version control procedures.  Currently, it only supports
remote Subversion repositories, but work is being done to include
support for others, including Perforce.  By the time you read this,
that support may be implemented.  This will provide yet another way of
working with the Perl source code.
