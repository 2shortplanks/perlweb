Developing games with Perl and SDL on Ars Technica written by Andy Bakun
L<http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2006/02/games-perl.ars>

Note this is old.

=head2 A Little History

Why are these pages new?  In October, David GE<ouml>hrig, the creator and
maintainer of SDL Perl, announced that he was quitting his job, selling all his
stuff, and going backpacking in Europe for a few months.  That left SDL Perl
without a maintainer or a home. But SDL Perl is back and running with Kartik and 
David's help.

=head2 Future Plans

We're working on polishing the latest code available to make the v2.5
release. Here is the roadmap so far. 
L<http://wiki.github.com/cthulhuology/SDLPerl>

Hopefully, Perl will soon be a wonderful language in which to write media
applications -- including games.

it can be improved a lot: L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-Fotagger>

=head2 Games

The original Frozen Bubble L<http://www.frozen-bubble.org/> is probably 
the most well known application written in SDL Perl.

Thomas Klausner has started a Space Invaders clone in SDL Perl. 
You can find the code on Github L<http://github.com/domm/Game-PerlInvaders>.

Kartik Thakore has started a falling block game
