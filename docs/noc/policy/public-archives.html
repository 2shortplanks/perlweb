<H1>Public Forum Archive Policy</H1>

<p>
Public fora, which include all developer and user mailing lists,
wikis, and issue reporting systems, are essential to perl.org.  It
should be understood that communications sent to such fora may be
available to the public for eternity.
</p>
<p>
Maintaining a publicly accessible archive of those communications
is a vital component of the services we provide to our community.
They serve as a both a public historical record and a searchable
repository of our activities.
</p>
<p>
On rare occasions it becomes necessary to make modifications to our own
archives.  This document describes the circumstances and procedures 
under which such modifications may be made.  Please note that it is
common practice for others not affiliated with perl.org to provide 
archives of our public fora as well.  This document pertains soley 
to the archives made directly available through hosts within the 
perl.org domain.
</p>

<h2>
   Disclaimer
</h2>

<p>
All communication sent to our public fora - the public mailing lists,
wikis, issue reporting systems and any other perl.org contribution mechanism -
is deemed to be published by the sender of that communication and
made public without condition.  Any disclaimers that may be attached
to said communication that describe it as private or non-redistributable
are self-contradictory and thus null and void.  perl.org is not responsible for removing or otherwise concealing your
communication after you caused it to become public.
</p>

<h2>
   Circumstances for Archive Modifications
</h2>

<p>
We generally only consider requests for editing or exising
material contained in the archive when requested by the sender
of the archived communication.  We will consider each case on its
individual merit, and weigh each modification against the damage
done by altering the historical record.  In the past
we have denied more requests than we have honored, in order
to protect the integrity of the archives.
</p>
<p>
We will usually edit or remove information only in the event 
of an inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, 
such as a social security number; however, a sender's contact
information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) does not 
fall into that category.  We most certainly do not edit the 
archives as a means of reducing one's exposure to spam.
</p>

<h2>
   Procedures for Archive Modifications
</h2>

<p>
The sender of the archived communication should submit a request
to webmaster at perl.org.  Each request should include the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A detailed justification, clearly indicating the requisite sense of urgency.</li>
  <li>A precise description of the material to be edited.
      Please include specific urls wherever possible.</li>
  <li>A statement indicating an understanding of this policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each request will be handled confidentially and with appropriate
care;  however, please keep in mind that perl.org
is a volunteer organization.  We will do our best to handle each 
request as quickly as we can.
</p>
