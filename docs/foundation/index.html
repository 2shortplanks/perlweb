<h2><a name="nlnetparrot">April 16, 2005</a> - NLnet Sponsors Parrot</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.nlnet.nl">NLnet</a>, a non-profit organization
supporting open source network technology research and development,
announced on Friday that it will sponsor US $70,000 of Parrot
development work. The funding will go to Leopold T&ouml;tsch who has
been the pumpking for Parrot since 2003 and Chip Salzenberg who
recently stepped into the role of chief architect for Parrot.  NLnet's
contribution will allow Salzenberg and T&ouml;tsch to concentrate on
completing the first two Parrot development milestones from the Perl
Foundation's <a
href="/gc/grants/2005-p6-proposal.html">funding
proposal</a>: API specification and stub implementation for 9 critical
subsystems. (They will each receive $5k at the start of a milestone,
$1k on the completion of each subsystem for the milestone, and $3.5k
on completion of the milestone.)
<p>
Wytze van der Raay, financial director for NLnet, commented "NLnet has
observed the evolution of Perl into one of the essential tools for
developing internet applications and managing internet services. The
Parrot architecture is promising to add features of special importance
to network applications, while simultaneously opening up the
technology for several other dynamic languages. One of NLnet's major
goals is to remove road-blocks for Open Source projects like Parrot.
Thus we look forward to being part of this project, and hope that
other organisations will follow our example." Allison Randal,
president of the Perl Foundation responded: "Our heartfelt thanks go
to the whole team at NLnet. Their contribution will significantly
accelerate the 1.0 release of Parrot."
