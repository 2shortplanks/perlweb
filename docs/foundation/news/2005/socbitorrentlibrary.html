[% page.title = page.banner %]

<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's 
<a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program 
and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. 
This is the sixth in a series of informal interviews finding out more information 
about thes e projects. Up now is Josh McAdams with "BitTorrent Peer Library For Perl".</p>


<p><b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you are a student 
and what you are studying</b><br>
My name is Josh McAdams.  I'm 25 years old and am working on a Master's of Computer 
Science at the <a href="http://www.ualr.edu/">University of Arkansas at Little Rock</a>... 
hopefully I'll be done by the end of the year and can breath again.</p>

<p><b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be doing? 
How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b><br>
My SoC project is to create a BitTorrent peer using Perl.  Uri Guttman has 
volunteered to be my mentor, so we are going to use his 
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/stem/">Stem</a> system to create a BitTorrent 
peer implementation.  In the end, I hope to have something that I can upload to 
CPAN so that others can easily include BitTorrent downloads in their Perl programs.</p>

<p><b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br>
I started listening to podcasts a few months ago and decided to brew my own podcatcher 
using Perl.  However, some of the podcasts that I liked used BitTorrent for their file 
distribution method.  I went searching for a set of modules that I could use in my 
scripts and came up empty handed.</p>

<p><b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b><br>
Hopefully it will be a success and will continue to be maintained and live on CPAN.</p>


<p><b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?  Got a blog?</b><br>
I haven't posted much about it yet, but I'll try to drop some entries in 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~jmcada/journal/">my journal</a>.</p>

<p><b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br>
Not really.  And of course, Google didn't help my confidence any by waiting until 
the day after their deadline to announce accepted projects.</p>

<p><b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?</b><br>
I was going to to do the project anyway as part of my Master's thesis<nobr> <wbr></nobr>:)  
At least now I'll have some guidance and can make it good.</p>
