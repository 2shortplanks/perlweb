<h2> Parrot 0.3.1 "Wart" Released! </h2>

<p>
On November 6th, 2005, Parrot pumpking Leo T&ouml;tsch released Parrot 0.3.1.
See the <a href="news/2005/Parrot-0.3.1.html">Parrot
0.3.1 release announcement</a> for more details or <a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/L/LT/LTOETSCH/parrot-0.3.1.tar.gz">download
Parrot 0.3.1</a> from the CPAN. 
</p>

<h2> What is Parrot? </h2>

<p> Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute
bytecode for interpreted languages. Parrot will be the target for the final
Perl 6 compiler, and is already usable as a backend for
<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a>, as well as variety of 
<a href="/languages/">other languages</a>.
</p>

<h2>Where Are We?</h2>

<p>To keep up to date on current developments, check out <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/">This week on Perl 6</a> by
Matt Fowles and Piers Cawley which covers the Parrot and Perl 6 mailing lists. 
Piers's summaries will appear on
<a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/xml/atom10/category/perl-6-summaries/feed.xml">
this RSS feed</a> first.</p>

<p>Parrot supports two primary languages,
<a href="examples/pasm.html">PASM</a> (assembly), and
<a href="examples/pir.html">PIR</a>, both of which are compilable to
bytecode.
</p>

<p>
Parrot has 
objects,
threads,
garbage collection,
a JIT compiler,
namespaces,
subroutines,
coroutines,
continuations,
NCI (ability to call native libraries),
multi-method dispatch,
multiple charset string support, and
cross-platform bytecode portability.
</p>

<p>Parrot has a growing standard library which can be used by any high level
language implementors targeting parrot. This includes PGE, the Parrot Grammar Engine, which
has a working implementation of the new
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/design/syn/S05.html">Perl 6 Rules</a>.


<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>

<p>
    Parrot development takes place on the perl6-internals mailing list.
    If you follow this list, you'll be able to get an idea
    of what sort of things are needed.

    Subscribe by sending mail to <a
    href="mailto:perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org">perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org</a>
    or read the <a
    href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals">perl6-internals NNTP
    archive</a>.  </p>

<p> There is documentation in the <code>docs</code> subdirectory of the Parrot
source, with an snapshot here of <a href="docs/">svn-latest
documentation</a>.</p>

<p> There is a <a href="todo.html">list of TODO items</a>.</p>

<p> Patches of all natures are welcome. See the <a href="patchfaq.html">patch
FAQ</a> for details.  </p>
