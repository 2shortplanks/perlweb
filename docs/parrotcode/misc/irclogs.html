<a href="parrotsketch-logs/">Logs from both parrot channels</a> on irc.perl.log
are now available. 
</p>

<h1><tt>#parrot</tt></h1>
<p>
Daily discussions of parrot development occur here, and the channel
is often the first introduction newcomers have to working on the
project. There's often a committer around who can answer questions
</p>

<p>
Both developers and users (a.k.a compiler authors) are
welcome in this discussion. Larger language development efforts may
have their own channels.

<h1><tt>#parrotsketch</tt></h1>
<p>
Each week, a group of developers working on Parrot and Parrot-related
projects gathers online to discuss progress, changes and the state
of the metaphorical weather.  This meeting currently occurs each
Tuesday at 18:30 UTC, in the <tt>#parrotsketch</tt> channel on 
irc (irc.perl.org).
</p>

<p>
Participating in the meeting is by invitation only, however
lurkers are welcome, and non-invitees may send private messages
to the participants with questions or comments.
