<p>All proposals must be submitted through the Google Summer of Code
website.  The below is a suggested format, but not required.  What's
important is that you provide as much information as possible.
Technical details don't all need to be figured out, they can be ironed
out on the mailing lists after the project starts.  Remember, all
Summer of Code projects should be large enough for you to work on full
time for almost three months.  Be sure that you've read the <A
HREF="http://code.google.com/soc/studentfaq.html">FAQ</A>.  Proposals
without enough information will be rejected.</p>

<p>The Drupal project wrote up two wonderful pages on <A
HREF="http://drupal.org/node/59963">Student Requirements</A> and <A
HREF="http://drupal.org/node/59037">How to Write a Proposal</A>.  We
suggest you read them both.</p>
 
<p>Plain-text is best, following something like this format:</p>
