Title: Summer of Code: Extended Type Inference System for Perl 5

<p>The Perl Foundation took part in Google's 
<a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> 
program and managed to get 
<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/news/2005/googlesoc2.html">8 projects funded</a>. 
This is the fifth in a series of informal interviews finding out more 
information about these projects. Up now is Gary Jackson with "Extended 
Type Inference System for Perl 5".</p>

<p><b>Hi there! Tell us a bit about yourself, including age, where you
are a student and what you are studying</b><br>
I am 27 and studying Computer Science at the University of Maryland.  I'm a
degree-seeking graduate student after a five year hiatus from school.</p>

<p><b>You've had a Google Summer of Code project funded. What will you be
doing? How will you be doing this? What's the final product?</b> <br>
I'm extending a type inference system for Perl 5 that I wrote this past
Spring to handle aggregate data types, objects, and type qualifiers (if time
allows).  The idea behind this project is to provide a tool to Perl
programmers who wish to use it, not to enforce some stuffy type system on
all Perl programmers.</p>

<p><b>How did you get interested in this topic?</b><br>
I took a graduate level programming languages course this past Fall, and I
took a language-based security class in the Spring.  I think some of the
tools and techiques we talked about in those classes could help make Perl
programs more robust.</p>

<p><b>Where do you see your project going after this summer?</b> <br>
I plan on writing an academic paper about it and submitting it to
conferences and journals.  If this project is worthwhile, I could go a long
way with it.</p>

<p><b>Is there any way to track your progress over the next few months?  Got 
a blog?</b><br>
Not yet, but I'll get one soon. </p>

<p><b>Did you expect to get funded?</b><br>
Not really.  Mine was an eleventh-hour entry and a bit of a lark.  I expected 
to hear some sort of feedback about my project, but heard none.  The acceptance 
letter was a complete surprise.</p>

<p><b>Got a silly fact about yourself or the project?</b><br>
Everyone I tell about the project thinks I'm crazy.  To a certain extent,
they are right.  I do not believe that a sound type system can be written
for Perl 5 programs (at least, not useful Perl 5 programs).  However, I
still think that type inference techniques can catch some meaningful errors
at compile time.</p>
