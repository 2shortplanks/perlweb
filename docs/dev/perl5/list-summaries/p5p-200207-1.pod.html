<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (17 july 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (1-7 July 2002)</A></H1>
<P>It's time to resurrect the weekly mailing list digest tradition. And
because good traditions evolve, the perl5-porters mailing list digest will
now be published here, at use Perl, on Mondays.</P>
<P>This was a quiet week, as all weeks since the code freeze and the release
candidate cycle.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="less discipline in the docs">Less discipline in the docs</A></H2>
<P>Elizabeth Mattijsen suggested to consistently replace the term
``discipline'' by ``PerlIO layer'' in the docs, the two being rather
equivalent (as implied by the perliol manpage, section ``Layers vs
Disciplines''). Nick Ing-Simmons (who wrote the largest part of the PerlIO
docs) supported that, but pointed out that the Third Camel uses the term
``discipline'' in some places, so it should not be removed completely from
the PODs.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="perlio::via">PerlIO::Via</A></H2>
<P>Also from the PerlIO department : there was a longish thread (continued
from the previous week) about the <CODE>PerlIO::Via</CODE> interface. This module
allows to define and load pure-perl PerlIO layers, defined as classes that
provide some simple tie-like interface. (For example, in perl 5.8.0 RC 2,
<CODE>MIME::QuotedPrint</CODE> provides such an interface, allowing to read and write
quoted-printable data transparently via a normal filehandle.)</P>
<P>The conclusion, as summarized by Elizabeth, was to encourage people to
define such PerlIO/Via layers in the <CODE>PerlIO::Via::*</CODE> namespace. I submitted
a patch to make <CODE>PerlIO::Via</CODE> assume this default namespace prefix : thus,
when you write</P>
<PRE>
    open $fh, &lt;:Via(Foo), $file</PRE>
<P>the module <CODE>Foo</CODE> is first searched, and if not found, perl tries to use
<CODE>PerlIO::Via::Foo</CODE>. Elizabeth and I then moved our relevant CPAN modules
from the short-lived <CODE>IOLayer::*</CODE> namespace to <CODE>PerlIO::Via::*</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="weird parsing bug with encoding.pm">Weird parsing bug with encoding.pm</A></H2>
<P>Elizabeth (again) found also a bug related to the <CODE>encoding</CODE> pragma.
<CODE>encoding</CODE> allows to write perl scripts in non-ascii (or utf8) encodings.
Apparently, under the effect of <CODE>encoding 'utf8'</CODE>, when the perl tokenizer
sees a string literal containing malformed utf8 data (e.g. iso-latin1), it
fails silently, replacing the value of the string constant by undef
(instead of, say, warning or throwing a fatal error). This apparently may
lead to weird parser problems, which makes me think that this bug will not
be fixed in 5.8.0.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="most common opcodes combinations">Most common opcodes combinations</A></H2>
<P>Arthur Bergman, who has taken over Simon Cozens' <CODE>optimizer</CODE> module, made
some statistics about the most common opcode combinations produced by the
perl parser. The idea behind this is to introduce new combined opcodes
during the optimization phase : for example, replacing two chained gvsv
ops (i.e. scalar variable access) by a single double-gvsv op. It appears,
from the first benchmark he ran, that the performance gain may be slightly
noticeable.</P>

<P>Jarkko was still on the road this week, but found the time to release a
snapshot while doing laundry.</P>
