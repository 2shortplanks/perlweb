<dt><b>Jacinta Richardson</b></dt>
<dd>
Jacinta has been credited for saving more than one Perl Monger group
from dying and is often heralded as the "gardener of the Australian
Perl Community", in the sense that she provides energy while subtly
encouraging others to take responsibility. She is an active member in
every Monger group in Australia, as well as many other FLOSS groups in
the area.  Her resume includes working to organize OSDC,
Linux.conf.au, and SAGE conferences.  She also works with Perl
Training Australia in supporting the Perl community with such ventures
as perl.net.au and Perl Tips.

<dt><b>Tatsuhiko Miyagawa</b></dt>
<dd>
Despite his considerable technical contributions to Perl, Miyagawa is
an active community organizer and advocate for Perl. He is so active
in the Perl community that it is rumored that he never sleeps. For the
past three years, he has been one of the main organizers for
YAPC::Asia -- helping that event to break worldwide YAPC attendance
records. He has organized numerous meetings for Shibuya.pm, growing it
to one of the largest Perl Monger groups in existence and frequently
organizes cross-language meetings and events.

<dt><b>Gabor Szabo</b></dt>
<dd>
Gabor Szabo is also a three time YAPC organizer (YAPC::Israel) and is
also involved with OSDC::Israel and multiple Hungarian Perl
Workshops. His contributions to the greater Perl community consist of
countless weblog entries, comments, emails and support.  His support
of the Israel Perl Monger groups have made them some of the most
vibrant in the world.
