=head2 A Little History

Why are these pages new?  In October, David GE<ouml>hrig, the creator and
maintainer of SDL Perl, announced that he was quitting his job, selling all his
stuff, and going backpacking in Europe for a few months.  That left SDL Perl
without a maintainer or a home.

=head2 Future Plans

We're working on polishing the latest code available to make the 1.20.4
release, as the newest version on the CPAN is rather old.  Then, it's
miscellaneous cleanups, more documentation and tutorials, bugfixes, and new
features as they come in.

Hopefully, Perl will soon be a wonderful language in which to write media
applications -- including games.

We'll be making archives of the old mailing list available.  Subscribe to the
development list by sending an e-mail to C<sdl-devel-subscribe@perl.org>.
