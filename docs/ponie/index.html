<h1>Press Release</H1>



<h2>Two year investment from Fotango to lead the development of Perl 5 running on top of Parrot.</h2>
OSCON 2003, Portland, OR (July 8, 2003) -- The Perl Foundation (TPF) is
pleased to announce the formation of the Ponie Project, a bridge between
Perl 5 and Perl 6.  The Perl 5 interpreter will be rewritten to run on
Parrot, the Perl 6 virtual machine.  This will ensure the future of the
millions of lines of Perl 5 code at thousands of companies around the
world.
<p>
Fotango's two-year commitment will allow Arthur Bergman, a Senior
Developer at the company and the main contributor to the Perl 5.8
threading effort, to help TPF coordinate and steer the Ponie project
externally with the Perl community and internally within Fotango.
</p>
<p>
"Ponie changes all the rules. Parrot will be the heart of Perl 6.
Bringing Parrot to the heart of Perl 5 is very exciting," said Simon
Wardley, Fotango's COO. "Ponie will offer a clear road forward for
companies contemplating the Perl 5 to Perl 6 transition."
</p>
<p>
"Fotango has been working with the Perl community for some time now."
said Allison Randal, President of The Perl Foundation. "Ponie is not
only important for Perl 5, but for Perl 6 as well. With Fotango's
involvement and sponsorship we are confident in the route the Ponie
project is taking."
</p>
<p>
Perl 6 is the next version of the Perl programming language. Perl 6 is
currently in the design stage and is coordinated by Larry Wall, inventor
of the Perl language, Damian Conway, the author of 'Object Oriented
Programming in Perl' and Allison Randal, the president of the Perl
Foundation. Parrot, being coordinated by Dan Sugalski, is the virtual
machine designed for dynamic languages that will run the next version of
Perl.
</p>

programming language through open discussion, collaboration, design, and
code. The Perl Foundation is a unit of the Yet Another Society (YAS), a
