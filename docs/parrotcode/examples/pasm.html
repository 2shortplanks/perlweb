<h2>Are you <b>sure</b> you want PASM?</h2>

When you're writing code for parrot, most of the time you will want
to be generating PIR code, not PASM. That said, here's some examples!

<h2>Hello world!</h2>

<p>
The first example clearly has to be one that prints out &quot;Hello
world!&quot;.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  # ``the'' example
  print &quot;Hello world!\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>When you run this example, you'll get:</p>

<pre class="pre output">Hello world!
</pre>

<p>
Note that the first line of code is a comment, which starts with a
'#' character - everything until the end of the line is ignored
comment. 
</p>

<h2>Registers</h2>

<p>
Parrot has four types of registers: 
integer,
float,
string,
pmc.
</p>

<p>
The integer, float, and string registers are the basic types used by parrot.
PMCs correspond to classes or objects.
</p>

<p>
One of the few advantages PASM provides over raw bytecode is that it matches
the opcode <tt>print</tt> in PASM to the appropriate print variant.
The print opcode that takes a single argument, for example, has eight variants. 
PASM automatically translated our <tt>print</tt> to <tt>print_sc</tt>, or
print-string-constant.</tt>
</p>

<h3>Assignment</h3>

<p>
Assignment between registers is done with the <tt>set</tt>
operator. The following code sets the first integer register to 1, the
first number register to 4.2 and the first string register to
&quot;Resting&quot;
<p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 1
  set     N1, 4.2
  set     S1, &quot;Resting&quot;
  print   I1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   N1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   S1
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">1, 4.200000, Resting
</pre>

<p>
Note how it seems that the print operator is polymorphic - it can
print integers, numbers, strings, and string constants. Actually,
these are all separate operators (for details look in
<a href="/docs/ops/core.html"><tt>core.ops</tt></a>) - the assembler
decides which to use, keeping our code simple.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>set</tt> operator can also copy between registers of
the same type.
</p>


<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 10
  set     I3, 30
  set     I1, I3
  print   I1
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">30
</pre>

<p>
Remember that the first operand is the destination register, so that
last command sets the value of register I1 to the value of register
I3. That is, I1 will hold the value 30.
</p>

<p>
To copy between registers of different types, the <tt>set</tt>
operator is also used:
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 10
  set     N1, I1
  set     N2, 4.2
  set     I2, N2
  print   N1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   I2
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">10.000000, 4
</pre>

<p>
Note that at the moment there
are no operators to convert from or to strings.
</p>

<h2>Arithmetic opcodes</h2>

<p>
A number of Parrot opcodes are concerned with arithmetic. The
<tt>inc</tt> and <tt>dec</tt> opcodes increase/decrease an integer
or number register by a constant. If no constant is given, 1 is
assumed.
</p>


<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 10
  inc     I1       # I1 is now 11
  inc     I1       # I1 is now 12
  inc     I1       # I1 is now 13
  set     N1, 42.0
  dec     N1       # N1 is now 41.0
  dec     N1       # N1 is now 40.0
  dec     N1       # N1 is now 39.0
  print   I1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   N1
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">13, 39.000000
</pre>

<p>
More common arithmetic operators are: <tt>add</tt>, <tt>sub</tt>,
<tt>mul</tt> and <tt>div</tt>, which add, subtract, multiply and
divide the contents of registers:
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 2
  set     I2, 4
  add     I3, I1, I2  # I3 is now 6 (2+4)
  sub     I3, I1, I2  # I3 is now -2 (2-4)
  mul     I3, I1, I2  # I3 is now 8 (2*4)
  div     I3, I2, I1  # I3 is now 2 (4/2)
  add     I1, I1, 5   # I1 is now 7
  set     N1, 1
  set     N2, 3
  div     N3, N1, N2  # N3 is now 0.333333
  print   I1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   N3
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">7, 0.333333
</pre>

<p>
Note that <tt>add I1, I1, 5</tt> is also valid: both constants
and registers are allowed for the last operand.
</p>

<p>
There are also <a href="/docs/ops/math.html">other arithmetic operators</a>,
 such as <tt>mod</tt>
(modulo) and a whole host of transcendental operators (<tt>sin</tt>,
<tt>cos</tt>, <tt>pow</tt>, <tt>exp</tt>, <tt>log10</tt>...).
</p>

<h2>String operators</h2>

<p>
Parrot includes a minimal set of <a href="/docs/ops/string.html">
string operators</a>: <tt>length</tt>
(find the length of a string), <tt>chopn</tt> (remove characters from
the end of the string), <tt>concat</tt> (concatenate one string to the
end of another), <tt>substr</tt> (extract substrings), <tt>repeat</tt>
(repeat a string), <tt>index</tt> (search for a substring):
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     S1, &quot;Fourty&quot;
  set     S2, &quot;two&quot;
  length  I1, S2       # I1 is now 3
  print   I1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  concat  S1, S2       # S1 is &quot;Fourtytwo&quot;
  concat  S3, S1, S2  # S3 is &quot;Fourtytwotwo&quot;
  substr  S2, S1, 0, 4 # S2 is &quot;Four&quot;
  chopn   S1, 3        # S1 is &quot;Fourty&quot;
  print   S1
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   S2
  print   &quot;, &quot;
  print   S3
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">3, Fourty, Four, Fourtytwotwo
</pre>

<p>
Note that the two-argument <tt>concat</tt> concatenates the second
string onto the end of the first: unlike most other operators is does
not create a whole new concatenated string. There is a three-argument
version which can do this, however.
</p>

<h2>Branching and conditionals</h2>

<p>
Branching is terribly useful in a program. The <tt>branch</tt>
operator is similar to a &quot;goto&quot;, and takes a label. Labels are
presented at the start of the line with a colon. 
</p>


<pre class="pre code">  set     S1, &quot;Beautiful&quot;
  branch  CHOIR
EX:
  print   S1
  branch  END
CHOIR:
  set     S2, &quot; plumage!\n&quot;
  concat  S1, S2
  branch  EX
END:
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">Beautiful plumage!
</pre>

<p>
The following conditional operators are available: <tt>eq</tt>
(equal), <tt>ne</tt> (not equal), <tt>lt</tt> (less than), <tt>le</tt>
(less than or equal), <tt>gt</tt> (greater than), <tt>ge</tt> (greater
than or equal). They take two integer or numeric registers and a label
to jump to if the condition is true. If the condition is false, then
execution goes to the next statement.
</p>
<p>
The following code prints the
numbers from 1 to 10, by looping over until I1 is greater than 10:
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 1
REDO:
  gt      I1, 10, END
  print   I1
  print   &quot; &quot;
  inc     I1
  branch  REDO
END:
  print &quot\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
</pre>

<p>
The conditional operators take a register and either a constant or
another register.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>if</tt> opcode tests if a register holds a true value. Any
value other than zero is true.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  set     I1, 1
  if      I1, TRUE
  print   &quot;False!\n&quot;
  branch  END
TRUE:
  print   &quot;True!\n&quot;
END:
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">True!
</pre>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>
Subroutines are a vital part of larger programs.
</p>

<p>
The simplest kind of subroutine is one that does not pass or return
arguments. The important operators here are <tt>bsr</tt> (Branch
SubRoutine, which jumps to a label) and <tt>ret</tt> (RETurn, which
returns from a subroutine). The following code jumps to a subroutine
named <tt>HELLO</tt> which prints a message and returns.
</p>

<pre class="pre code">  bsr     HELLO
  end

HELLO:
  print &quot;Hello there!\n&quot;
  ret
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">Hello there!</pre>

<p>The parrot calling conventions have recently changed. While examples
will be generated for PASM-based calling conventions, it is recommended
that you use PIR for actual subroutines.
</p>

<h2>PMCs (Parrot Magic Cookies)</h2>

<p>
PMCs are a completely abstracted data type; they may be string,
integer, code or anything else. They are roughly equivalent to the
SV, AV and HV (and more complex types) defined in Perl 5, and
almost exactly equivalent to PythonObject types in Python.
</p>

<p>
The various types of PMCs shipped with Parrot are defined in the file
<tt>include/parrot/pmc.h</tt> 
</p>

<p>
To use a PMC, you must first create it using the <tt>new</tt>
operator. You can then assign it a value and treat it much like the
lower-level types. The following code creates two Integer PMCs and
adds them together.
</p>


<pre class="pre code">  new P0, .Integer
  set P0, 123
  new P1, .Integer
  set P1, 321
  add P1, P1, P0
  print P1
  print &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output">444
</pre>

<p>The following code concatenates a number and a string. </p>

<pre class="pre code">  new     P0, .Integer
  set     P0, 42
  new     P1, .Integer
  set     P1, &quot; is the answer!&quot;
  concat  P0, P0, P1
  print   P0
  print   &quot;\n&quot;
  end
</pre>

<p>Prints:</p>

<pre class="pre output"> 42 is the answer!
</pre>

<p>
You may notice that in the last example, we declare P1 as an Integer type,
but then set it to a string value.  As with their Perl or Tcl counterparts,
PMCs have the ability to change their own type on the fly. (also known as
morphing or shimmering). If you trace this code: <tt>parrot -t1 foo.pasm</tt>
...
</p>

<pre class="pre note">     0 new P0, 30                       P0=PMCNULL 
     3 set P0, 42                       P0=Integer=PMC(0xf004f4: 0) 
     6 new P1, 30                       P1=PMCNULL 
     9 set P1, " is the answer!"        P1=Integer=PMC(0xf004e0: 0) 
    12 i_concatenate P0, P1             P0=Integer=PMC(0xf004f4: 42) P1=String=PMC(0xf004e0 Str:" is the answer!")
    16 print P0                         P0=String=PMC(0xf004f4 Str:"42 is the answer!")
    18 print "\n"
42 is the answer!
    20 end

</pre>

<p>... you see that the P0 and P1 registers are both initialized as the same
type (Integers), but at line 12, the concat opcode is processing a Integer
(P0) and a String (P1). The assignment on line 9 morphed the PMC in P1 to a 
different type automatically.
</p>
