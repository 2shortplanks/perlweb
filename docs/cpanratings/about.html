<b>Adding reviews is currently broken!</b>. (see the <a href="http://log.perl.org/2005/07/cpan_ratings.html">noc weblog post</a> for more details).

<ul>
<li>July 20, 2005: Changed to use <a href="http://www.bitcard.org/">Bitcard</a> for authentication.  Added "was this review helpful" votes.  Also changed the URLs to be a little nicer (we couldn't do that while using the old auth server (don't ask)).
<li>September 28, 2004: Bugfix to the "show reviews" page by Ivan Tubert-Brohman.
<li>August 13, 2003: RSS finished, validating distribution names now, lots of other tweaks.
<li>August 11, 2003: Very much a beta.  Comments to <a href="mailto:ask@perl.org">ask@perl.org</a>.
</ul>
