<h2>July 16, 2002: 2001-2002 Perl Foundation Grant Recipients</h2>

<p>
We thank the Perl Community for their support in making these grants
such a success and the recipients who have worked so hard while being
funded by the Perl Foundation!

<h3><a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/" class="aLink">Damian Conway</a></h3> <p>
	<img src="/images/Damian_perl.jpg" alt="Damian Conway">
</p>
<p>
	Damian Conway received a TPF grant in 2002, which was continued from 2001, due to his unflagging energy and enthusiasm for Perl 6. For eighteen months he brought enthusiasm to Perl Mongers and Perl Conferences around the globe. His Exegeses have made the Apocalypses accessible to a wider range of Perl users and his extensive background in computer languages has proven invaluable in the design of Perl 6. He is a delightful, skilled speaker who never fails to impress and instruct. We are gratified Dr. Conway accepted the grant and the amazing volume of work and travel he has done with the funding. The Foundation also thanks those hundred of members of the Perl Community whose support and donations made funding Damian for 18 months a reality. We are also grateful to his wife, Linda, for bearing with his long absences travelling.

	<img src="/images/Dan_perl.jpg" alt="Dan Sugalski">
</p>
<p>
	Dan has been a member of the Perl Community for a number of years primarily doing work on the VMS port of Perl. He is currently the internals designer for Parrot, the interpreter engine for Perl 6. We think he dreams in VAX assembler. The work on Parrot has progressed with the aid of the grant since Dan had more time to devote to the project. We are excited to have been able to offer this opportunity and hope we will be able to continue aiding the development of the Parrot engine in the future.

<h3><a href="http://www.wall.org/" class="aLink">Larry Wall</a></h3> <p>
	<img src="/images/Larry_perl.jpg" alt="Larry Wall">
</p>
<p>
	Larry Wall is the creator of Perl. He has also authored several other popular free programs available for Unix, including the <i>rn</i> newsreader and the ubiquitous <i>patch</i> program. By training Larry is a linguist who has a fondness for Hobbits. Larry is the keystone of the Perl 6 design team and funding his work writing the design documents (or as he whimsically refers to
them: the "Apocalypses") has permitted development to advance swiftly. We will continue to facilitate the Perl 6 design and development as funding allows. The Foundation is indebted to Larry for his tireless work on the difficult task of designing the language, and to the many contributors who have supported this effort with RFCs, feedback and contributions to TPF.
