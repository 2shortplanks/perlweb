<h3>Mark Jason Dominus - Debugger</h3>

DISCUSSION:

<p>What is wrong with the existing debugger?

<ul>
<li>The current debugger is 2600 almost-unreadable lines of magic and
special cases.  Its structure is a giant if-else tree that looks at
the command that was entered and then executes some code depending on
the command.  The only way to define a new command or to alter the
behavior of an existing command is to hack on this giant if-else tree.
Bugs in the debugger are hard to repair because the debugger is not
written in a modular style.</li>

<li>The debugger is full of weird code that nobody understands.  Every
time some bright person got a clever idea for a clever feature, they
hacked it into the core code for the debugger.  Some of these features
are incompletely implemented; some just don't work.  For example,
there is supposed to be a feature in the debugger that detects when
the target program calls fork(), and will start up a fresh terminal to
follow the child process.  There is code for this feature in the
debugger, but as far as I know nobody knows how to use it.  It is not
documented.</li>

<li>The debugger has no test suite.  It has been repeatedly broken by
changes that could not be adequately tested.  Because of the existing
architecture, it would be very difficult to add a test suite.</li>

<li>The debugger is not adequately configurable.  Every time some
anal-retentive pinhead decides to rationalize the command set, or to
extend a command, or add a new command, they do it in the core, and
everyone else has to live with the changed behavior.</li> 

<li>The debugger promotes bad programming practices.  People often
write this code:

<pre>
        my $I = mkdir(...);
        if ($I) { 
          ...
        }
</pre>

   This could be written more briefly and clearly as:

<pre>
        if (mkdir(...)) {
          ...
        }
</pre>

   When I suggest this in my classes, a common reply is that the long
   version is better because the user will be able to examine the
   return value of 'mkdir' in the debugger *before* the branch is
   taken.  This is a good answer, and it points directly at a defect
   in the debugger.  There should be an option to place a breakpoint
   after the condition is evaluated, but before the branch is taken.
   Perl can support this, but the debugger won't do it.  Similarly,
   one might like to place a breakpoint in the middle of an expression
   like this:

<pre>
        $result = complicated_subexpression_1 + complicated_subexpression_2;
</pre>

   and have the debugger stop automatically, display the value of
   complicated_subexpression_1, and offer an opportunity to change it
   before evaluation of the expression continues.</li>

<li>I have been studying the way people use debuggers.  Most debuggers,
   including the perl debugger, are awful.  As far as I can tell,
   debugger technology has not advanced a single step since 1962.
   Perl can do better. I have at least half a dozen ideas for useful
   debugger features that people will wonder how they ever got along
   without.
<p>
   Here is a simple and obvious example.  Everyone has the experience
   of discovering that they have stepped three steps past the place
   where they wanted to stop.  Then they sigh, kill the debugger, and
   start over.
<p>
   A debugger that can be stepped backwards is probably impossible.
   But there's no reason why the debugger can't remember the sequence
   of commands you used to get it to where it is, and then accept a
   command that says "Start over, and do everything just the same, but
   stop three lines sooner."  This is easy and obvious, but the Perl
   debugger doesn't do it.</li>

<li>The debugger will not debug regexes.  I wrote a regex debugger
   back-end several years ago.  I put new features into the core to
   support better regex debugging.  Then neither I nor anyone else
   followed up.  If I rewrite the debugger, I can integrate regex
   debugging support into it.</li>
</ul>

<p>DELIVERABLES:

<ol>
<li>A reusable library of essential debugger functions.  This library
   would abstract out the weird debugger guts manipulation that is
   necessary to display source code, set break points, and so on.
   Debugger applications could be written atop this library.
<p>
   The library should be designed to be easily subclassed so that
   people can extend it.  Useful extensions would eventually be merged
   back into the core library.  The subclassing interface should be
   well-documented. 
<p>
   If the underlying implementation of Perl's built-in debugger
   features changes, only the library would need to be rewritten.
   It's easy to imagine that the debugger facilities in Perl 6 or even
   Ponie will be very different from the one we have now.  If this is
   true, the current debugger will have to be thrown out anyway.  Any
   work done on the old debugger from now on will be wasted.
<p>
   The library should support plugins for sub-debuggers that take
   control at certain points in the debugging process.  The regex
   debugger would be one of these plugins.
<p>
   I may also deliver some small core patches if they enable
   comparatively large improvements in debugger function.  For
   example, consider a graphical debugger in which one can point to a
   variable on the screen and immediately see its current value.  This
   is much easier for debuggers to do if the Perl lexer provides a
   little support for it.</li>

<li>A replacement debugger application.  The new debugger application
   will be backward compatible with the current debugger, but the
   architecture will be different.  Instead of being a giant
   monolithic application, it will be a thin front-end to the debugger
   library.  Building new debuggers will be easy to do by writing new
   thin front-ends.  
<p>
   If some anal-retentive pinhead wants to rationalize the command
   set, it should be possible to tell them to do it in their own copy
   of the debugger.  If we can't stop them from touching the Perl
   distribution, we should at least be able to have their changes in
   as an option which can be enabled or disabled.</li>

<li>A working regex debugger.  The regex debugger should be integrated
   with the debugger front-end and easily usable in conjunction with
   it.</li>

<li>A test suite for the library and for the standard debugger
   application.  The architecture of the front-end application must be
   designed to allow easy regression testing.</li>

<li>Complete documentation. The library and front end should be
   well-documented, to encourage development of alternative and
   experimental debuggers.</li>

<li>Six months after the delivery of items 1-5, I will deliver a report
   on the mistakes made in the project and lessons learned.</li>
</ol>

COMMENTS:
<p>
I think this project needs to be done as soon as possible.  Ponie and
Perl 6 are coming along.  When that happens, we will need to redo the
debugger from scratch anyway.
<p>
Fred Brooks said "Build one to throw away; you will anyway."  My
debugger will be the one we can throw away, if we want to.  Of course,
I will do it absolutely as well as I can so that we don't have to
throw it away.  If we don't, that is excellent.  If we do throw it
away, it will be because my project taught us a lot of things about
what mistakes we shouldn't make.  If I don't do this project first, we
will make those same mistakes when it really matters, in the Perl 6
debugger.
