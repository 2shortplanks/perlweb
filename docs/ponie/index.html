<h1>Ponie has been put out to pasture</h1>

<p>August 23rd, 2006</p>

<p>
Over the past several years, one key aspect of the migration plan to
Perl 6 has been the Ponie project, a fusion of the Perl 5 runtime with
Parrot. Sponsored by Fotango, Artur Bergman and Nicholas Clark did a
heroic job cleaning up Perl's internals to make it possible to replace
some components of Perl 5 with Parrot, one piece at a time, while
still keeping the core of the Perl 5 runtime intact with 100%
bug-for-bug compatibility. Along the way, Nicholas ported several
significant Perl core improvements from Ponie back to the Perl 5.9
tree.
</p>

<p>
Ponie never really became a community project. All significant work
was done as part of Fotango's sponsorship. When it had good momentum
and sponsored developers, it needed a number of Parrot features that
weren't yet available. At this point, Ponie has not been in active
development for almost half a year and it's my unhappy duty to declare
the project dead.
</p>

<p>
Norman Nunley is currently working to do a final extraction of
unharvested improvements from the Ponie code before we put it out to
pasture. Lots of good came out of Ponie, just not the good things we
expected.
</p>

<p>
A number of very talented hackers are currently exploring multiple
strategies to enable most Perl 5 code to run seamlessly along side
Perl 6 in Parrot. Folks have already demonstrated a proof-of-concept
Parrot VM embedded in the Perl 5 runtime. Work is underway on a Perl 5
to Perl 6 translator and the existing Perl 6 compiler on Parrot is the
proof of concept for a similar implementation of a "regularized" Perl
5. At this point, it wouldn't be reasonable to bless any one right way
forward but each of these techniques (and possibly others) could play
a part in whatever "5 on 6" scheme we end up with. No matter what
happens, we're committed to making your Perl 5 code play well with new
Perl 6 code.
