<pre>
=head1 Top 100 modules from CPAN

How the list is determined doesn't really matter.

The list will definitely be hand-tweaked.

Separate into strata.

=head1 What to avoid

sprintf() breaking in PHP

(-3)**3 == 27

=head1 The improvements

The muster tests are not "extra" tests.  We're adding to the distros.

We will check against docs and code and tests.  All should be in sync.

=head1 Author involvement

Want to involve the authors.  It's good for everyone.

If they refuse, that's OK.  We can go without them.

We'll find some people who Get It, do their modules, and then make
it public what we've done.

=head1 Testing guidelines

Come up with good guidelines

Test the edge cases

Work it into the core.

=head1 Test::Harness improvements

Improve the protocol

Add randomizing.

Add stats

=head1 Stats

Need to keep track of what the improvements to the distros are.
If we add tests, we need to track that.

=head1 Interested parties

Testing cabal

acme

Autrijus

cogent

Fox

=head1 Stuff to add/drop

Sky says: No Tk, no libnet

=head1 misc

We WILL find bugs.  They're there.

Tests will get folded into the main distribution of the module.
We'll create the patches and feed 'em back.

We'll check documentation vs. tests vs. code, too.

Need a central place for the musterers.

The elf army slide is the key image.

Doesn't rely on Ponie.  Testing will be critical with Ponie.  If DBI breaks under Ponie, it's no good for anyone.

Perl core will be part of it.

Need some sort of repository so people can collaborate

Check module dependencies

Test all pod against Test::Pod

Need a tracking mechanism to track progress.  maybe an RT queue.

CPAN is the standard library of Perl.

Stats are approximate: Kwalitee

Many modules may not need much help.

Proactive defense

Use Devel::Cover and gconv

How much of the perl code and C code in the core is acutally covered by the core tests?
