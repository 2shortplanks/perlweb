<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (28 september 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (2-8 September 2002)</A></H1>
<P>As September begins, the perl5-porters, ignoring the changing weather,
continue to work. This week, some small things, and a few bigger ones,
are selected in the report. Read below.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="precision on clones">Precision on CLONEs</A></H2>
<P>Elizabeth Mattijsen found that, while executing a CLONE method (the hook
to support cloning of data when new threads are created), <CODE>threads-&gt;tid</CODE>
returns the thread id of the original thread. This is because the cloning
is actually performed (at the C level) in the parent thread.</P>
<P>However, to execute some routine when a new thread starts, and from this
new thread, a workaround is to hijack <CODE>threads::new</CODE>. Nick Ing-Simmons
also suggested to implement some sort of post-clone handler via another
special subroutine (for example CLONED).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="a point on vstrings">A point on v-strings</A></H2>
<P>John Peacock, the man who courageously continues to struggle with
v-strings, posted a <EM>restatement of current objections to version
objects</EM> -- version objects being what the v-strings should be compiled to
internally by perl, in order to make them less unusable.</P>
<P>The thread is worth a read if you are annoyed by v-strings and if you want
to have some idea on how they're likely to change.</P>

<P>To quote Hugo, <EM>Larry continues to like them</EM> [the v-strings] <EM>despite
various attempts to convince him otherwise, so they are here to stay. I
think they could become much less of a bugbear if John's sterling work
culminates in a consistent and appropriately documented set of
behaviours.</EM> Waiting for the v-string objects Apocalypse...</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="pseudohashes should warn before they die">Pseudo-hashes should warn before they die</A></H2>
<P>Now that pseudo-hashes are removed from bleadperl, Gurusamy Sarathy
noticed that using them doesn't trigger any deprecation warning in perl
5.8.0. Jarkko is considering adding one in perl 5.8.1.</P>
<P>Benjamin Goldberg also started a thread on the implementation-to-be
of the <CODE>fields</CODE> pragma in perl 5.10.</P>

<H2><A NAME="jaguar and camel">Jaguar and Camel</A></H2>
<P>Jarkko Hietaniemi found out that Perl 5.8.0 doesn't compile on Mac OS X
10.2 with the August update of the Developers Tools, due to a small
communication problem between the Configure script and Apple's modified
gcc 3. He also provided a fix for that, which you can grab here if you
need it :</P>

<P><EM>Last minute update</EM> : has Jarkko dreamed ? have the sunspots moved ?
He's apparently no longer able to reproduce this bug.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Abe Timmerman is now the official maintainer of Test::Smoke.
See <EM><A HREF="http://qa.perl.org/">http://qa.perl.org/</A></EM> for more info about smoke testing.</P>
<P>Steve Piner reported an (already known, IIRC) bug : <CODE>my $x; our $x;</CODE>
doesn't generate a warning, whereas <CODE>our $x; my $x;</CODE> does. (Bug #16922.)</P>
<P>H.Merijn Brand, doing some speed experiments, <EM>found that perlio has
slowed down considerably compared to stdio from 17805 to 17821</EM>. No
confirmation or comment was issued.</P>
<P>Allen Smith provided some patches to bleadperl and to perl 5.8.0 to
improve IRIX support, namely on long doubles, and their handling by
<CODE>s?printf()</CODE>.</P>
<P>The perl5-changes mailing list now carries the changes committed by Hugo,
and all previously dropped changes have been sent back to it, for the
purpose of archiving.</P>
<P>Sadahiro Tomoyuki released a new version (0.23) of Unicode::Collate.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Mattijsen, after having uploaded a first version of
<CODE>Thread::Exit</CODE> on CPAN, found that <CODE>POSIX::_exit()</CODE> makes perl hang on
Linux when called from within a thread (bug #17057). This problem is
probably related to the Linux implementation of threads.</P>
<P>Elizabeth emitted the idea to start a new FAQ section on threads.</P>
<P>Hugo is leaving for Zurich (the Perl 6 mini-conference) and to Munich
(YAPC::Europe).</P>
