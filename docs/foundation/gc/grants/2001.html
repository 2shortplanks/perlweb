In 2001, the first Perl Development Grant was awarded to Dr. Damian
Conway, a well-known academic, speaker, writer, and Perl module author
(<a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/</a>).
<p>
The Perl Foundation coordinated the collection of corporate and
private donations, which were sufficient to fund Dr. Conway for twelve
months. That funding covered salary at US$55,000, and provided an
additional US$20,000 budget for travel.
<p>
During 2001 Dr. Conway contributed to the community through Open Source
code development, writing, lectures, and presentations. His travel
budget allowed Dr. Conway to share his extensive knowledge of
programming with audiences around the world, facilitating broad
discussion of his work, and enabling him to be actively involved in
community and individual projects through face-to-face seminars and
in-person meetings.  
<p>
Over the course of the year, Dr. Conway's contributions to the Open
Source community have been far greater the relatively small cost of
his grant. Those contributions have included: 
<p>
<ul>
	 <li>Developing 14 significant new Perl modules
(Regexp::Common, Filter::Simple, NEXT, Text::Reform,
Attribute::Handlers, Attribute::Handlers::Prospective,
Perl6::Variables, Perl6::Classes, Attribute::Types,
Inline::Files, Hook::LexWrap, Sort::Explicit,
Class::Delegation, and Attribute::Multimethods); </li>

	<li>Updating 7 widely-used Perl modules he had previously
written (Switch, Text::Balanced, Text::Reform, Lingua::EN::Inflect,
Getopt::Declare, and Class::Multimethods);</li> 

	<li>Collaborating closely with Larry Wall on the design of Perl 6;</li>

	<li>Writing explanatory documents describing the features of
Perl 6 (the Exegesis series and an article in The Perl Journal);</li>

	<li>Travelling to 20 cities in USA, England, Germany, Canada,
Australia, and India to deliver over 400 hours of public talks to Perl
and Linux user groups, as well as keynotes, seminars, and tutorials at
major Open Source conferences.</li>
</ul>
