<h3>Jan 26, 2005</h3>

<h4>Rough Status:</h4>

<ul>
<li> PPI core is largely stable now.

<li> Tinderbox testing completed. Only 28 out of 38,000 files crash the parser.

<li> Beta 1 released still missing ::Transform and the ->insert_before/after methods, but that's about it.

<li> Today I'm transferring the bulk of the code to the SourceForge
project.
</ul>


<p>From this point, I expect development to sort of "dribble along" as
people try it out and I get feedback. But the bulk of the work other
than the talk (which I'll write for OSCON assuming I make it there) is
pretty much done now.</p>

<h3>Feb 25, 2005</h3>

<p>Beta release done as before, going through the firming up process,
recieving input from people testing it out, and the odd bug
report.</p>

<p>Rather than rushing through beta to 1.0, I've decided to let it
"dribble" out, and time a 1.0 release for just before OSCON, which
will match up against my anticipated talk on PPI for the OSCON.</p>

<p>Only noteworthy item is the refactoring and inclusion in the core
of the PPI::Normal document normalization code.</p>

<h3>April 1, 2005</h3>

<p>Same status as last month with the following exception: "Only major
development event was final commitment and completion of the last of
the object tree memory management, and thus reaching 100% leak-safe
and auto-DESTROY'ability."</p>

<p>Still plans more bug-fixing, docs, and tests.  Realized that the initial deadline wouldn't serve the user base well so is planning a 1.0 release the month before OSCON.  Users are starting to send bug reports.</p>

<h3>May 2, 2005</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1/3rd of the remaining docs complete
<li> Completed final version of ->location functionality
<li> Various bits and pieces
<li> I mentioned final leak-safe'ness previously right?
</ul>

<h3>May 31, 2005</h3>

<p>More of the docs completed, errors bubble upwards correctly, unified ->new parameters to all APIs, Added initial latin-1 extended char support.</p>

<p>Wrote article for perl.com, to appear shortly.</p>
