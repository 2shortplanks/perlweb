<p>
The Perl 5 developer team is pleased to announce the Perl Release
5.6.2, second in the maintenance track of perl 5.6.0.
</p>

<p>
Perl 5.6.2 is being released to fix the build issues with the newest
compilers, libraries and operating systems that have appeared since
the release of perl 5.6.1 (notably gcc 3, AIX 5, Mac OS X). A few
modules have been upgraded as well; see the <A
HREF="http://search.cpan.org/~rgarcia/perl-5.6.2/pod/perldelta.pod"
>perldelta</A> document for the complete list.
</p>

<P>
It is available via the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network as <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RG/RGARCIA/perl-5.6.2.tar.gz"
>ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/R/RG/RGARCIA/perl-5.6.2.tar.gz</A>.
</P>

<P>The md5 checksum is 6aa648d086ecda5400de3472dbe1ebfe, and its size is 6255479 bytes.</P>

<P>This is a source code release, not a binary release. You will need
a C development environment to build the sources. To build and install
Perl, and to find out how to report problems, please read the INSTALL
file, and any relevant README.platform file.</P>

<P>As specified in the licences for Perl (see the files named Artistic
or Copying), THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.</P>

<P>As always, you should conduct an appropriate level of testing before using any new product in your production environment.
</P>
