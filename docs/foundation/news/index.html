<dt><b>Stas Bekman</b></dt>
<dd>
Stas Bekman has been a tireless advocate for large-scale applications
in Perl and, of course, mod_perl. He went from an occasional asker of
questions on the mod_perl list to answering many questions, and had
the forethought to write it all down, creating and maintaining the
mod_perl guide which quickly grew to over 600 pages. Recently, he made
himself available for free talks to Perl Mongers groups during a trip
covering North America, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.

<dd>
Eric Cholet may be familiar to you as the technical manager of the
YAPC Europe Foundation and as co-author of A Conference Toolkit (ACT),
which has been used to administer several European YAPCs. More
importantly, though, he works behind the scenes at perl.org,
moderating the mailing lists we all use. If you've noticed the absence
of spam on a perl.org mailing list, filters help, but Eric catches
what falls through.

<dt><b>Andy Lester</b></dt>
<dd>
Andy Lester is one of the prominent voices advocating testing and
quality assurance. He has written extensively on the importance of
good testing and maintains qa.perl.org. He is also the creator and
project leader of Phalanx, which is devoted to improving tests and
test coverage of Perl and CPAN modules to maintain quality as
development continues. Phalanx encourages interaction between
programmers by having groups of developers work together to improve
test coverage on the most used CPAN modules.

<h2>July 19, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/yapcna2006cfv.html">YAPC::NA::2006 Call for Venue</a></h2>
<p>With the close of another successful YAPC::NA, it is now
time to throw open the call for venues for next year's (2006) YAPC::NA
conference.</p>

<p>You can get details on what a YAPC venue needs at 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. 
When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and possible dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.</p>

<p>As with last year, we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a href="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a>
for more information on this. This shows
the catgeories under which venues will be reviewed to be able to bring
another great conference to you, at the lowest cost possible.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are
due by Friday, September 2 2005, with a decision due on September 16 
2005. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about N weeks,
which should be manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.</p>

<p>This is your chance to bring a YAPC to your town. It's a very rewarding
experience, and is a great way to give to the Perl community. If you
have questions about writing a proposal, you can send them to
<a href="mailto:yapc-venues_AT_yetanother_DOT_org">yapc-venues AT yetanother 
DOT org.</a></p>
