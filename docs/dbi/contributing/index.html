            <h3>What is DBI?</h3>
            <p>&quot;The DBI is the standard database interface module for Perl. It defines 
              a set of methods, variables and conventions that provide a consistent 
              database interface independent of the actual database being used.&quot;</p>

	      Many people have contributed to the DBI and its
	      database drivers in many ways over many years.<p>

              <p> <span class="TOPIC">Contributing Help on the dbi-users Mailing List</span><br>
              The dbi-users <a href="/support">mailing list</a> is the heart of the DBI user community.
              There are typically over two thousand users subscribed, ranging from novices to
              experienced users and driver developers.
              Messages are on-topic and the list is widely regarded as being of very high quality.
              It's a great way to learn about the DBI and, as you learn from the
              list and your own experience, you can help others along their path.

              <p> <span class="TOPIC">Contributing Changes and Enhancements</span><br>
		If you'd like the DBI to do something new, or different, a good way
		to make that happen is to do it yourself and send me a patch (diff)
		to the source code that shows the changes. Information about how
		to do that can be found <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/DBI.pm#CONTRIBUTING">here</a>,
		(including an important note about talking to me first to avoid duplicated or wasted effort).

              <p><span class="TOPIC">Sponsoring Specific Changes or Enhancements</span><br>
		If you'd like a specific change or enhancement made to the DBI, and you don't
		want to do it yourself or wait hopefully for it to happen sometime in the future,
		then you or your company can hire me to do the work for you.
		The addition of the swap_inner_handle() method, for example, was sponsored by BizRate.com.
		I have my own consultancy company and will usually offer a fixed price quote
		and fast delivery.

              <p><span class="TOPIC">Sponsoring DBI Development</span><br>
		Almost all the development of the DBI over the last
		10 years has been done in my own spare time.
		My consultancy work and family commitments limit my spare time now,
		and a backlog of planned changes and significant enhancements
		has accumulated.  These are documented in the
		<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI/Roadmap.pod">DBI Roadmap</a>.

		<p>In order to implement these changes and enhancements myself
		(and devote time to effectively coordinate others who may help me)
		I would like to be able to take some time each week away from my consultancy
		business and devote it to making DBI enhancements that everyone can benefit from.

		<p>The Perl Foundation (<a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/">TPF</a>)
		has kindly agreed to setup a
		DBI Development fund to which (US tax-deductible) contributions can be made.
		An assigned Grant Manager will manage the fund and make payments from it
		in response to agreed enhancements being implemented from the Roadmap.

		<p>If your company has benefited from the DBI then this is an opportunity to
		both give back, by way of thanks, and help ensure even greater benefits in the future.
		Please take time out to consider if your company could make a contribution.
