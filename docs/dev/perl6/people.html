[% page.title ="Who's Who in Perl 6, parrot, &amp; Pugs" %]

<h1>Architecture &amp; Implementation Team</h1>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a> is the
inventor of Perl, <tt>rn</tt>, <tt>patch</tt>, and many other wonderful 
things.  He is the language designer for Perl 6, and has staked out the
perl5 to perl6 translator as his own project.</li>

<li><a href="http://damian.conway.org/About_us//Bio_formal.html">Damian
Conway</a> is helping Larry Wall with the design of Perl 6, providing a 
different perspective from most. He also writes the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">Exegeses</a>, which explain
by example Larry's design documents (the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>).<br><br></li>

<li><a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/">chromatic</a> is the project secretary.
He is at least partially responsible for delaying Apocalypse 12 with that Roles
idea but lays no particular claim to finding odd bugs. He also writes code.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> is the author of
PGE, the parrot/Perl6 Grammar engine. He's also the Perl 6 compiler pumpking.

<li><a href="http://www.luqui.org/">Luke Palmer</a> is the Perl 6 language list
monitor and co-author of the retroactive Synopses.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/allison.html">Allison Randal</a> 
is the current parrot architect and also hacks on the Perl 6 compiler tools. 
She started the
<a href="/perl6/doc/synopsis.html">Synopses</a> with Damian.
She disavows all knowledge of the buzz around &quot;topic&quot; and
&quot;tagmemics&quot;.
<!-- Her job is to coordinate the design of 
the parser, compiler, optimizer, and runtime engine.
-->

<li><a href="http://use.perl.org/~chip/">Chip Salzenberg</a> is the
current parrot pumpking, starting with release 0.4.6. He was also 
the parrot architect in a past life.
</li>

<li><a href="http://crypt.org/hv/">Hugo van der Sanden</a>, 
knows more about Perl 5 internals than any one person should, which
helps to make better decisions for Perl 6.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang">Audrey Tang</a> is the
primary force behind Pugs, a perl6 implementation that targets at least
four different backends, including JavaScript.

<li><a href="http://www.toetsch.at/">Leopold T&ouml;tsch</a> is 
currently the primary hacker on parrot internals. Leo was also the pumpking
for releases 0.0.13 - 0.4.5
</li>

<li><a href="http://use.perl.org/~jesse">Jesse Vincent</a> is the project
manager. His job is to
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,63099,00.html">herd
cats</a>.
