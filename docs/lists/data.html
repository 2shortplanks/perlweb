<h2>Contributing Changes</h2>

<p>We know that a lot of the data is out of date, as it has been
collected from a variety of sources.  Updates are welcome and
encouraged.</p>

<p>Please send patches to lists.json (available below) as unified
diffs (<code>diff -u</code>) to webmaster at perl.org.</p>


<h2>Data</h2>

<p>The underlying data for lists.perl.org is available for download in
JSON format: <a href="data/lists.json">lists.json</a>.
</p>


<p>
Key points:
<ul>
  <li>All tags should be sorted. (i.e. <code>$json->canonical(1);</code>)</li>
  <li>Top level keys should match <code>/^[a-z0-9_.-]+$/</code></li>
  <li><tt>archive, nntp, rssfeed</tt> may be lists.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>TODO List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Create a "short description" and "long description" for each list.</li>
  <li>Mark inactive lists as such.</li>
  <li>Move categorization into the JSON file (maybe a "tags" element?)
  instead of hardcoding in the templates</li>
  <li>Add missing lists. (There are some lists linked on the category
  pages that aren't in the JSON file, as well as lists we just don't
  know about.)</li>
  <li>Write an automated archive-scraper for updating the "last
  message" timestamp?</li>
  <li>Do we want to add all public perl monger lists?  If so, write a script to sync.</li>
</ul>
