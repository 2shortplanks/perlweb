<tr><td>
No member of the board of directors of the corporation who is a volunteer director, as that term is defined in the Michigan Nonprofit Corporation Act (the "Act"), shall be personally liable to this corporation for monetary damages for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty; provided, however, that this provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director for any of the following:

<p>1.	a breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation;
<br>2.	acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

<br>3.	a violation of section 551(1) of the Act;
<br>4.	a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit;
<br>5.	an act or omission occurring before the filing of these articles of incorporation; or
<br>6.	an act or omission that is grossly negligent.

<p>The corporation assumes all liability to any person, other than the corporation, for all acts or omissions of a director who is a volunteer director, as defined in the Act, incurred in the good faith performance of the director's duties. However, the corporation shall not be considered to have assumed any liability to the extent that such assumption is inconsistent with the status of the corporation as an organization described in IRC 501(c)(3) or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code.

<p>If the Act is amended after the filing of these articles of incorporation to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors of nonprofit corporations, then the liability of members of the board of directors, in addition to that described in Article IX, shall be assumed by the corporation or eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the Act as so amended. Such an elimination, limitation, or assumption of liability is not effective to the extent that it is inconsistent with the status of the corporation as an organization described in IRC 501(c)(3) or corresponding section of any future federal tax code. No amendment or repeal of Article IX shall apply to or have any effect on the liability or alleged liability of any member of the board of directors of this corporation for or with respect to any acts or omissions occurring before the effective date of any such amendment or repeal.
