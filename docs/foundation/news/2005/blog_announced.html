<p>
The Perl Foundation was established in December 2001, but is a mystery
to many people.  Today we announce
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation Blog</a> at
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">blog.perlfoundation.org</a>
(also available as
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/atom.xml">Atom</a>
and
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/index.xml">RSS</a>).
</p>

<p>
Perl Foundation News is the place to read updates on what members of the
Foundation's working groups are working on and for other project-related
announcements.  Where before a working group member might post an update
to his
<a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>
journal, or a meditation on
<a href="http://perlmonks.org">perlmonks.org</a>,
from today those updates and more will be appearing on the Perl
Foundation Blog.
</p>

<p>
The Perl Foundation's work includes:
<ul>
<li>sponsoring the <a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC</A> conferences and supporting their organizers
<li>managing <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/">grants</a> for Perl-related projects
<li>working with outside groups, as on Google's
    <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/2005-googlesoc.html">Summer Of Code</a> project
<li>putting a public face on the work of the Perl community
<li>providing <a href="http://noc.perl.org/">technical infrastructure</A> for web hosting and Subversion repositories
<li>supporting and coordinating volunteer efforts
</ul>
Now you can get information about these activities.
</p>

<p>
Comments are enabled, allowing you to give feedback directly to our
working group members. Talk directly to us and tell us what we're doing
right or wrong. Ask us questions and we'll do our best to answer. We
love comments and want to hear your views.
</p>

<p>
We're well aware of the problems of the past.  We know that communications
have been weak.  We're working hard for the trust of the Perl community,
and creating the Perl Foundation Blog is a crucial step as we work to
earn that trust.
</p>

<p>
Whether you want to participate in helping make the Perl community even
better, or interested in what's going on, we hope that
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">blog.perlfoundation.org</a>
helps.
