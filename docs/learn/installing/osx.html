<h3>
    A good setup for Perl on OSX is as follows.
</h3>

<ul class="instructions">
    <li>
        <a href=
        "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12&amp;ls=1">Install
        Xcode</a> through the Mac App Store (Apple charge a small amount for 
        this, it is a very large download), or from your OSX software DVD/SSD
         if possible (any version will work).
    </li>
    <li>Open the <em>Terminal.app</em> (Found in Applications -&gt; Utilities)
    and copy &amp; paste the following command below into it (then press the
    'return' key).
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>


<h3>
    Explanation of this setup
</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
    <li>To build and install Perl and many of the thousands of useful
        <a href="/modules/">Perl modules</a> you need to have a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>, for OSX the
        easiest way to get this is to use Apple's Xcode. Some versions of the
        OSX install DVDs or SSDs come with the 'developer tools', you can
        install using these, only 'unix tools' is actually required. No
        specific version of Xcode is needed, the latest is available directly
        through the App Store.
    </li>
    <li>To interact with the command line and run Perl commands, a terminal
    application is needed. OSX comes with Terminal.app by default, there are
    <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net">alternatives</a> available as well.
    </li>
    <li>OSX uses .bash_profile, but most other systems (and instructions) look
    for .bashrc, this code sets up .bash_profie to <em>also</em> run anything in
    .bashrc. There are <a href=
    "http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html">other
    differences</a> but these are not important to us.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> website lists many
    of it's advantages. We recommend it here because it separates your
    installation from the system Perl, this makes upgrading OSX less likely to
    cause issues with your own Perl setup. It also means you can use a newer
    Perl than the default one which comes with OSX.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> does let you have
        multiple versions of Perl installed (very useful for testing if you
        want to upgrade to a new version), for the purposes of learning Perl
        you will only need one version which is why we 'switch' to use this as
        the default.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus/">App-cpanminus</a>
        provides the <code>cpanm</code> tool, which makes <a href=
        "/modules/installing.html">installing modules</a> very simple to do.
    </li>
</ul>
