<p>PROJECT: Complete the Perl PPI Parser
<p>AMOUNT: $3,500
<p>DURATION: 2 months
<p>DISCUSSION:
<BR>PPI is a round-trip document parser for Perl source code.
That is, it parses a contiguous chunk of Perl source as a document
and not as code, and is able to perfectly reassemble a parsed
Perl document back into the original file (including whitespace and 
comments).

<P>For a general discussion on "Perl code vs Perl document" see
the introductory section of the PPI documentation at
<A 
HREF="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PPI</A>

<br>
<p>BENEFITS:
<br>
As the first practical working perl "parser" a huge number of
different benefits and spin-offs are expected.
Already available, using only the incomplete version are:

<UL>
<LI>PPI::Format::Apache: By far the most accurate HTML syntax highlighting 
module available
<LI>Perl::SAX:An event model for perl source code.
<LI>Perl::Compare + Perl::Signature: Functional signatures of perl code 
allow untrusted third parties to alter layout and improve POD while being 
certain that the changes have not altered the code itself.
<LI>CPANXR: Although suffering from bitrot at the present time and being
updated, the CPAN cross reference would allow complex searching
and linking of the entire of CPAN.
</UL>

<P>Potential future projects include automated or "guided" backporting /
forwardporting of code, auto-documentation, refactoring, and a variety of
other tasks as listed in the PPI documentation.
