<H2> What's Parrot </H2>
<P>
    Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for 
    interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although we would like
    to keep the door open for other languages in the future. As such,
    Parrot will be the core of the Perl interpreter; it will be the
    target platform to which Perl 6 code is compiled.
</P>

<H2>Where are we</H2>
<P>
    Parrot source code was released to the world on Monday 10th of September
    2001; since then, an army of developers have furiously been hacking away
    on it. Currently, we can assemble the Parrot assembly language to bytecode
    and execute it with a test interpreter.
</P>
<P>
    The Perl scalar type (string, integer and floating-point) has been
    implemented, along with basic array and hash types. We have global symbol
    tables, subroutines, a JIT, and a good intermediate language compiler.
</P>
<P>
    Sean O'Rourke has contributed a working Perl 6 parser and compiler
    for a significant subset of the perl 6 definition that currently exists.
</P>

<H2>How to get the code</H2>
<P>
    Periodic releases will appear on CPAN; the current release is
    version 0.0.10, and can be found in the CPAN 

    <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SF/SFINK/parrot-0.0.10.tar.gz">source directory</A>.

</P>
<P>
    For the very latest version of Parrot, check out the source from <A
    HREF="http://cvs.perl.org">CVS</A>. There is anonymous access to
    all, and commit access to those who have taken responsibility for
    various areas of the code or produced a large number of high-quality
    patches.
</P>
<P>
    Frequent automatic snapshots of the CVS tree are available <A
    HREF="http://cvs.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/">here</A>.

</p>

<p>
    For automatic <a href="http://qa.perl.org/">smoke testing</a> you can
    use rsync to synchronize a directory with a checked-out copy of the
    latest CVS tree.<br><br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync -av --delete cvs.perl.org::parrot-HEAD parrot</tt>

</P>

<H2>How to get involved</H2>
<P>

    Parrot development takes place on the perl6-internals mailing list.
    If you follow this list, you'll be able to get an idea
    of what sort of things are needed.

    Subscribe by sending mail to <A
    HREF="mailto:perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org">perl6-internals-subscribe@perl.org</A>
    or read the <a
    href="http://archive.develooper.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/">web
    archive</a> or the <a
    href="http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.internals">nntp
    archive</a>.


    When development of the Perl6 language needs an internals list we
    will move the parrot list to the parrotcode.org domain.


</P>
<P>
    There is documentation in the <code>docs</code> subdirectory of the
    Parrot source, and the design documents can be found <A
    HREF="http://dev.perl.org/pdd/">here</A>.
<P>
    A TODO list is being developed, and can be found <A
	HREF="http://www.parrotcode.org/todo">here</A>.
<P>
    Patches of all natures are welcome. See the <a
    href="http://www.parrotcode.org/patchfaq">patch FAQ</a> for details.

    Bugs and to-do items can be viewed and manipulated at the <A
