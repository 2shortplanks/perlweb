<pre>
This statement sets forth the privacy policy for all mail lists and Web
sites operated under the perl.org domain.


1) Perl.org web sites automatically collect the following information when
you visit:

The Internet protocol (IP) address from which you access our web site.
The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.
The date and time our site is accessed.
The pages visited.
The last site you visited, if that site contained a link to a perl.org web
page.

This information is maintained in site logs.  We use this information for
site maintenance and administrative purposes only.  This information does
not identify you personally.

We will not sell or share this information with anyone outside of perl.org
volunteers.

2)Cookies

Some perl.org Web sites use persistent cookies to store information.  This
information does not identify you personally.  You do not have to accept
persistent cookies to use perl.org sites.

3)E-mail you send us

When you send us personally-identifying information in email, we use the
information you provide only to help us respond to your inquiry. In an
effort to respond to your request, information you submit may be viewed by
perl.org volunteers.  We do not maintain this information or provide it to
others.

4)Other information we may collect

At times, we may ask you to voluntarily send us information, for example
user survey data.  We will not provide this information to others.  Such
information may be presented publically as anonymous tabulations only.

5) Mail List Archives

Perl.org hosts and archives many Perl community mail lists, but not all.
To help prevent SPAM, email addresses appearing in archived messages are
not disclosed.  Names are included as they appear in the messages.   We do
not provide email address information to others.  Adresses will be
provided to a new host server should our mail lists move to one.

Perl.org volunteers will not remove messages from any archive unless one
can demonstrate actual or probable harm to a person or business due to the
presence of the message.

We cannot control how messages are managed or archived at third party
sites, as some perl mail lists are.

If you subscribe to any perl mail lists, check its archive link at
http://lists.perl.org and see how messages are archived.  Unsubscribe from
any list if you are not comfortable with how it is archived.

6)Links to Third Party Sites

For the benefit of our visitors, perl.org sites contains links to third
party sites not operated by perl.org and its volunteers. Such sites are
not within the control of perl.org volunteers and may not follow the same
privacy policies as perl.org sites. Furthermore, we are not responsible
for the content or availability of those sites, their partners, or
advertisers.
