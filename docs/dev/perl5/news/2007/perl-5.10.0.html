<h1>Perl 5.10.0 Released</h1>

<p>
Today (December 18th, 2007) the Perl Foundation announces the release of Perl 5.10, the
first major upgrade to the wildly popular dynamic programming
language in over five years.  This latest version builds on the
successful 5.8.x series by adding powerful new language features
and improving the Perl interpreter itself.  The Perl development
team, called the the Perl Porters, have taken features and inspiration
from the ambitious <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/">Perl 6</a>
project, as well as from chiefly academic languages and blended
them with Perl's pragmatic view to practicality and usefulness.
</p>

<h2>Significant new language features</h2>

<p>
The new <b>smart match operator</b> implements a new kind of
comparison, the specifics of which are contextual based on the
inputs to the operator.  The result is that all comparisons now
just Do The Right Thing, a hallmark of Perl programming.  Programmers
can also <b>capture matches based on names</b>, rather than position
in the expression.  In addition, the regular expression engine has
been tweaked, tuned and sped up in many cases.
</p>

<p>
Building on the smart-match operator, Perl <b>finally gets a
<tt>switch</tt> statement</b>, and it goes far beyond the kind
of traditional <tt>switch</tt> statement found in languages like
C, C++ and Java.
</p>

<p>
Other improvements include <b>state variables</b> that allow variables to
persist between calls to subroutines; user defined pragmata that
allow users to write modules to influence the way Perl behaves; a
<b>defined-or operator</b>; field hashes for inside-out objects and
<b>better error messages</b>.
</p>

<h2> Interpreter improvements </h2>

<p>
It's not just langauge changes.  The Perl interpreter itself is
<b>faster with a smaller memory footprint</b>, and several UTF-8 and
threading improvements.  The Perl <b>installation is now
    relocatable</b>, a blessing for systems administrators and operating
system packagers.
</p>

<p>
Don't think that the Perl Porters are not resting on their laurels.
As Rafael Garcia-Suarez, the release manager for Perl 5.10, said:
"I would like to thank every one of the Perl Porters for their
efforts. I hope we'll all be proud of what Perl is becoming. And
ready to get back to the keyboard for 5.12."
</p>

<h2> Where to get Perl </h2>

<p>
Perl is a standard feature in almost every operating system today
except Windows.  Users who don't want to wait for their operating
system vendor to release a package can dig into Perl 5.10 by
downloading it from CPAN, the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
at <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/">http://search.cpan.org/dist/perl/</a>,
or from the Perl home page at <a href="http://www.perl.org/">www.perl.org</a>.<br/>
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/R/RG/RGARCIA/perl-5.10.0.tar.gz">Download from CPAN</a>.
</p>

<p>
Windows users can also take advantage of the power of Perl by
compiling a source distribution from CPAN, or downloading one of
two easily installed binary distributions.
<a href="http://strawberryperl.com">Strawberry Perl</a> is a community-built
binary distribution for Windows, and
<a href="http://activestate.com">ActiveState</a>'s distribution is
free but commercially-maintained.  ActiveState's distribution is available now, and Strawberry Perl's is imminent.
