<p>
Ponie is the project name for Perl 5.12, a bridge between Perl 5 and
Perl 6.  Ponie will bring Perl 5 to Parrot, the virtual machine at the
heart of Perl 6.  A project of this size and complexity takes plenty
of talent, and plenty of support, to complete.  The first phase of the
project has come to an end, and a new one is beginning.
