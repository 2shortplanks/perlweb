<h2> What is Parrot? </h2>

<p> Parrot is a virtual machine designed to efficiently compile and execute
bytecode for interpreted languages. Parrot will be the target for the final
Perl 6 compiler, and is already usable as a backend for
<a href="http://www.pugscode.org/">Pugs</a>, as well as variety of 
<a href="/languages/">other languages</a>.
</p>

<p> Parrot is not about
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=parrots">parrots</a>.
