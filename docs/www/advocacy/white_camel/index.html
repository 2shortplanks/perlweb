<P>
In the lands where the camel roams, the white (albino) camel is a rare
and revered individual.  The White Camel Awards recognize the many
significant contributions made by the unsung heros of the Perl
community.  The efforts of these volunteers collectively make the Perl
language and the Perl community better for all of us.
</P>

<P>
The awards were initiated by <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl
Mongers</a> and <a href="www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly &amp;
Associates</a> at the 1999 Perl Conference.  Today, <a
href="http://www.perl-foundation.org">The Perl Foundation</a>
acknowledges these exceptional individuals annually at the O'Reilly
Open Source Conference
