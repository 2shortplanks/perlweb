In rough order of priority
==========================

Make the cookie validation code not be hardcoded in Combust::Cookie (!)

Make Combust::Control::Basic read the right mime.types file.

Read the subversion revision or some "combust-release" file at startup time

/combust-status

Add the include_root and combust revision to the Etag.  If it wasn't
so expensive we could add docs revision as well.  Hmn.  Maybe not useful. 

Make the controller set the INCLUDE_PATH depending on the vhost (or document root?)
  - maybe use a separate configuration file so it's easy to specify
    pulling from svn or from a directory
    - possibly configured per branch?


Cache full html outputs?  Use master svn revision in the cache key. Or
maybe use svn revision for perl.org/backend/ combined with svn
revision for perl.org/docs/[site]/.

Set Last-Updated properly.

Handle If-Modified-Since requests.

Format POD as html when foo.html is requested and doesn't exist, but
foo.pod does.  Format POD as html when foo.pod.html is requested too.


In a year or three or maybe never
=================================

Migrate to XHTML and get all that <B>UPPERCASE</B> html lowercased.

Get content type from svn?
