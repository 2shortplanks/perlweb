<h3>CPAN.pm</h3>

As of release 1.75, CPAN.pm can correctly check the validity of
PAUSE-signed CHECKSUM files, and display the fingerprint ("2E66 557A
B97C 19C7 91AF  8E20 328D A867 450F 89EC" for 2003) for the user to
double-check.

Because CPAN.pm itself ships the PAUSE public key, it makes tampering
in the CPAN mirror level extremely likely to be detected.

It also uses Module::Signature to check for author-created embedded
SIGNATURE files inside the distributions, and refuses to install if it
does not match.

As the successor to CPAN.pm, CPANPLUS.pm now also supports all
features listed above, as well as checking detached ".sig" PGP
signatures.

<h3>Module::Build</h3>

As of release 0.19, Module::Build can correctly handle the "distsign"
action, as shown below:

<pre>
    % perl Build.PL
    Creating new 'Build' script for 'Module-Build' version '0.19'
    % perl Build distsign
    ...some interaction with the user...
    ==> SIGNATURE file created successfully. <==
</pre>

The "distsign" action can also be performed automatically during
"Build dist", if the user passes a true value as the "sign" argument
to <code>Module::Build->new()</code>. For example:

<pre>
    # Build.PL
    use Module::Build;
    Module::Build->new(
        module_name => 'Foo::Bar',
        license     => 'perl',
        sign        => 1
    )->create_build_script;
</pre>

Most of the implementation was carried out by Dave Rolsky and Ken
Williams, with input, support, and testing from me.                                                                                 
There is also a similar "make distsign" action provided by my
Module::Install framework for ExtUtils::MakeMaker users, and Michael
Schwern has agreed to take a patch in a future version of
ExtUtils::MakeMaker to support it natively. 

<h3>PAR</h3>

As of release 0.70, PAR can generate, sign, verify, install
and uninstall files containing SIGNATURE files.

<pre>
    % pp --sign --par --output=foo.par foo.pl    # produces signed PAR file
    % pp --sign --output=foo.exe foo.pl          # signed standalone executable

    % tar zxf DBI-1.37.tar.gz
    % par.pl -p DBI-1.37/                        # convert CPAN dist to PAR dist
    Successfully created binary distribution 'DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par'.

    % par.pl -s DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # sign an existing PAR file
    % par.pl -v DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # verify the signature
    % par.pl -i DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # install it directly
    % par.pl -u DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # uninstall it

    % par.pl -v http://foo.com/DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # works
    % par.pl -i http://foo.com/DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par  # this too
</pre>

It can also be used programatically with PAR::Dist, or like this:                                                   
<pre>
    use PAR;
    use lib 'http://foo.com/DBI-1.37-i386-freebsd-5.8.0.par';
    use DBI;
    print DBI->VERSION; # prints "1.37"
</pre>

The "cpansign" utility in Module::Signature has also been improved
to verify and sign PAR files, as well as verifying the digital signature
of pp-generated standalone executables.
