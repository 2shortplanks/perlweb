<p>Good projects...</p>
<ul>
  <li>...build on or integrate well with existing code</li>
  <li>...are a development of an existing project, rather than starting from scratch</li>
  <li>...provide more basic infrastructure or libraries that will provide the widest opportunities for others to build on the results of the proposal</li>
</ul>


<p>Some ideas...</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>Ajax library for Template Toolkit, akin to the Ajax support in Ruby in Rails (likely mentor: the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Catalyst</a> project).</li>
  
  <li>A visual SQL query-builder in Perl.</li>
  
  <li>Build a suite of tools around WxWidgets for cross-platform GUI apps with low overhead (i.e., don't require Tk or GNOME overhead).</li>
  
  <li>A Perl SOAP library including WSDL support.</li>

  <li>Automate smoke testing new Perl releases with CPAN (possible
  mentor: Adam Kennedy).</li>

  <li>Smoke testing architecture for binary compatibility between
  versions of Perl.</li>

  <li>Develop a strategy for useful benchmarking of the Perl
  core.</li>

  <li>Benchmarks for PGE (Parrot Grammar Engine) (likely mentor:
  Patrick Michaud)</li>

  <li> Profile Perl - measure the performance of the Perl interpreter
  using free tools such as cachegrind, gprof, and dtrace, and work to
  reduce the bottlenecks they reveal.</li>

  <li>A good chunk of things from the Perl 5 <a
  href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.7/pod/perltodo.pod#DESCRIPTION"
  >TODO
  list</a>. Good examples:

    <ul>
      <li>"The regexp optimiser is not optional" --  "Make the peephole optimizer optional"</li>
      <li>"iCOW" - unless Dave gets a mound of tuits between now and the summer.</li>
      <li>tokeniser/pads/UTF-8 --    The tokeniser isn't actually very UTF-8 clean. use utf8; is a hack -  variable names are stored in stashes as raw bytes, without the utf-8 flag    set. The pad API is all bytes. The UTF-8-ness of PL_rsfp is ignored.  All this could be fixed.</li>
      <li> "Attach/detach debugger from running program" which will inevitably snowball into a lot more debugger stuff.</li>
      <li>"fix tainting bugs" + "Make tainting consistent"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Polish up and finish off <a
  href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/20481">P5NCI</a>
  (likely mentor: chromatic).</li>

  <li> <a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/">LLVM</a> <-> Parrot interop
  (likely mentor: Leo T&ouml;tsch)</li>

  <li> Parrot as LLVM backend (LLVM -> PASM)</li>

  <li> PIR -> LLVM (not really, but evaluate optimizations)</li>

  <li> Implement well-known optimizations in PIR compiler (SSA -> register allocation)</li>

  <li> Runtime & offline bytecode optimization</li>

  <li>Parrot JIT: improve & complete JIT for some set of subsystems
  from alpha to Z8000 i.e. several pieces, one per platform</li>

  <li>Parrot threads: STM (software transactional memory as in GHC, et al.) for Parrot</li>


  <li>Improve TGE
    <ul>
      <li> allow complex node selectors in rules</li>
      <li> find and implement a rule syntax other than PIR</li>
      <li> complete and document the default PAST and POST objects</li>
      <li> make the default objects available to all projects</li>
      <li> refactor out a default compiler framework for all projects</li>
      <li>  optimize for memory use</li>
      <li>  allow interpretation as well as compilation</li>
      <li>  create a system that provides scaffolding of a new language 
        implementation</li>
      <li>  create default tree optimizations (SSA would be nice)</li>
      <li>  create default POST -> PIR rules</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
