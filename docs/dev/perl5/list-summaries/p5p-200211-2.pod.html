<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (1117 november 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (11-17 November 2002)</A></H1>
<P>I finally found time to produce a new instance of this weekly selection.
Read about Unicode chars in POD, an incompatible change in a widely (and
wisely) used module, a couple of new proposals, and a smaller than usual
amount of bugs.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="nonascii in pod">Non-ASCII in POD</A></H2>
<P>A thread was spawned from the B::Lint patch proposed by Ian Phillipps last
week. It's about non-ASCII chars in PODs (for example, &iuml;).
Apparently, some versions of <CODE>nroff(1)</CODE> are offended by characters with an
ASCII code &gt; 127, and <CODE>pod2man</CODE> should generate portable manpages
(although Russ Allbery said that he was considering a way to add an option
to <CODE>pod2man</CODE> to generate groff-specific manpages). Sean M. Burke
suggested to use the Pod::Escapes module to get rid of escape sequences
that can't be handled in the output format, and added some insight about
what the POD specification says on Unicode input.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="test::* modules change">Test::* modules change</A></H2>
<P>Michael G. Schwern released a new alpha version of
Test::Simple/More/Builder. An important change is that <CODE>threads.pm</CODE> is no
longer automatically loaded on an ithread-enabled perl. Hence it will be
necessary to <CODE>use thread</CODE> <EM>before</EM> loading Test::More or Test::Builder
to run tests that use threads.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="assertions in perl">Assertions in Perl</A></H2>
<P>Salvador Fandino send an impressive patch to add assertion support to
Perl. Briefly, a new sub attribute <CODE>assertion</CODE> is used to mark subs as
assertions, and those assertions are enabled via a new command-line
switch, <CODE>-A</CODE>. Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes found that it's a great idea. The
pumpking hasn't commented on this yet.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="cpan::makemaker">CPAN::MakeMaker</A></H2>
<P>Brian Ingerson posted an announcement of his CPAN::MakeMaker module on P5P
last month, and didn't receive any comments until this week, probably
because the implications of this awesome hack are difficult to figure out
at first sight.</P>
<P>CPAN::MakeMaker is a replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker. It's also
self-distributing : it's part of the MakeMaker-generated tarball, hence
doesn't need to be installed on the users' systems -- in fact it gets
never installed on the users' systems.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="version bug">Version bug</A></H2>
<P>Andreas Koenig apparently found a bug in <CODE>version.pm</CODE>. Basically he
states that</P>
<PRE>
    use version;
    $v = version-&gt;new(5.00563);
    print $v-&gt;numify;</PRE>
<P>should print ``5.00563'', and not ``5.005063'', since it should be equivalent
to 5.5.630, and not to 5.5.63. The correct interpretation of the relevant
chapter and verse of perl56delta are required to define the proper
behavior.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Sean M. Burke announced a shinier, <EM>refactored, and generally
refunkified</EM> version of the <CODE>perldoc</CODE> utility, available from CPAN if you
want to test it. It's of course aimed at replacing the current <CODE>perldoc</CODE>.</P>
<P>Bug #18306 shows that B::Xref sometimes reports random file names with a
threaded perl. Apparently the problem comes from the perl core, not from
B::Xref.</P>
<P>Dave Mitchell sent a patch to add more information to the infamous error
message <CODE>Scalars leaked</CODE>, by printing the adresses of the leaked scalars.
It's enabled by the new preprocessor symbol <CODE>DEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS</CODE>.</P>
<P>H.Merijn Brand still chases Cygwin bugs through a deep smoke screen.</P>
