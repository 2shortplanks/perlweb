<OL>
<LI> do a diff -u of the file(s) you want to patch
   (note: Win32 users will probably need -ub)

<LI> redirect the output to a file (any name will
   do, .patch extension is conventional)

<LI> create a new email message

<LI> set the recipient to: bugs-parrot  at  bugs6.perl.org
   (note there's no need to CC the mailing list,
   it will find its way to it)

<LI> prepend [PATCH] to the subject

<LI> be very, very informative about what you're
   doing, both in the subject line and the message
   body

<LI> attach the patch file you generated in step 2
   (DON'T paste the content in the body, attach the
   file!)

<LI> send and wait patiently.
