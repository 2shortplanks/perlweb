<h3>April 1, 2005</h3>

<p>Plans for an initial publishing of the site within a couple of
weeks.  Still unsure about authentication: "Last I heard, there were
no plans to add more services to the "old" perl.org authentication
system, but the new one (Sau::Client) was not ready yet. I wrote again
today, Worse case, I could use my own authentication initially and
move to the perl.org system when it becomes available."</p>

<p>Plans submitting talks at YAPC::NA and an article to Perl.com.
Also plans to contact the administrators at cpanratings, cpanforum,
and search.cpan.org to discuss interlinking the sites.</p>

<h3>May 2, 2005</h3>

<p>I've been "almost ready" to launch the annocpan.org site for at least a couple of weeks. The main problem is that the perl.org authentication is not ready. I've contacted Ask several times but he always says something like "real soon now". The good thing about this delay is that in the meantime I've found and fixed many bugs and added some of the less essential features that were pending; the bad thing is that I want to launch the site and I'm getting tired of waiting. I'm seriously thinking about doing it this weekend, auth.perl.org or not.</p>

<p>Other than that, I submitted my abstract for YAPC::NA and signed a
contract with perl.com to publish an article on the building of
AnnoCPAN.</p>


<h3>May 31, 2005</h3>

<p>My article for perl.com was accepted and will be published on June 23.  I didn't get a long talk accepted for YAPC::NA but I'll try a lightning talk instead.</p>

<p>The annocpan site is in the same situation as the previous month (missing the authentication part). I've decided to finish my own authentication and the heck with it unless a miracle happens. However, I thought it might be a nice touch to make the official announcement coincide with the article being published in perl.com. It's only a few days before YAPC::NA as well.</p>
