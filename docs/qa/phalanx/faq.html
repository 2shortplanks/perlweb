<h1>Q&amp;A about the Phalanx Project</h1>

<h2>How did you come up with the <A HREF="/phalanx/100/">Phalanx 100</A> list?</h2>

The specifics of how we derived the list isn't really important.
We don't want the focus of the project to become which modules are
getting attention.  We'll be working on a wide variety of CPAN
modules, as well as Perl itself, to improve their tests and
documentation.

<h2>No, but really, did you look at logs or something?</h2>

It really doesn't matter.  The list is made and that's what we're
going with.  We think you'll agree that the 100 modules are a good
cross-section of what's popular on the CPAN.  Maybe some got missed,
maybe some shouldn't be on the list.  Still, it's a good start.

<h2>Why 100?</h2>

It's a nice round number that is about 2.5% of CPAN.  We figure
that the 80/20 rule applies, but in this case, 97.5/2.5 will have
to do.

<h2>So, I bet you got logs from somewhere, right? Did you look at CPANTS?</h2>

OK, ok, we'll tell you!  It's a combination of:
<UL>
<LI>Log analysis of search.cpan.org for the last 45 days of 2004
<LI>Some manual editorial adjustments
</UL>

<h2>Well, you know, you could have...</h2>

Yes, yes, we know.  The list has been made and will probably not
change.

<h2>But Foo::Bar is a LOT more important than DBI!</h2>

That's fine.  We can include Foo::Bar in the Phalanx project as
well.  The list of 100 is just a starting point.
