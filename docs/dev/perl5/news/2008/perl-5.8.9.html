</p>

<p>5.8.9 is a maintenance release for perl 5.8, incorporating various
minor bugfixes and optimisations.  Please see the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.9/pod/perl589delta.pod">perldelta</a>
for the full details. Please report bugs using the
<code>perlbug</code> utility. If the build or regression tests fail,
<code>make nok</code>. If the build fails to early to run this, please
mail perlbug at perl.org directly.
</p>

<p>If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to <tt>perl5-security-report@perl.org</tt>. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able to
help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help co-ordinate
the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all platforms on
which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for security issues in
the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on CPAN.
</p>

<p>We have only limited volunteer labour, and the maintenance burden is getting
increasingly complex. Hence this will be the last significant release of the
5.8.x series. Any future releases of 5.8.x will likely only be to deal with
security issues, and platform build failures. Therefore you should look to
migrating to 5.10.x, if you have not started already. Alternatively, if
business requirements constrain you to continue to use 5.8.x, you may wish to
consider commercial support from firms such as ActiveState.
</p>

<p>This is a source code release, not a binary release.  You will need
a C development environment to build the sources.  Binary releases
will be made available by various vendors.  To build and install Perl,
and to find out how to report problems, please read the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.9/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
file, and any relevant README.platform file.  As specified in the
licenses for Perl (see the files named <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.9/Artistic">Artistic</a>
or <a

THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.  As always, you
should conduct an appropriate level of testing before using any new
product in your production environment.
