<h2>
Language</h2>

<blockquote>The brainstorming process finished August 1, 2000, resulting
in 361 <a href="/rfc/">RFCs</a> (Requests for Change).&nbsp; They range
from suggestions to rants, and Larry is looking at them closely as he develops
the language.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Larry Wall is producing <a href="apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>,
language design documents that reflect his ideas of how the Perl language
will change between versions 5 and 6 (in parallel, Damian Conway is producing
<a href="exegesis/">Exegeses</a>,
sample code and explanations of techniques outlined in the Apocalypses).&nbsp;
The community is giving him feedback on the perl6-language mailing list,
pointing out possible sources of confusion, alternate routes, etc.&nbsp;
This can cause Larry to revise decisions he made in earlier Apocalypses.&nbsp;
When all Apocalypses are produced, commented upon, and possibly revised,
we'll have a picture of the perl6 language.</blockquote>

<h2>
Internals</h2>

<blockquote>
  Dan Sugalski is coordinating the internals design, preparing the
  <a href="pdd/">Perl Design Documents</a> (PDDs) with the community
  on perl6-internals.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Simon Cozens originally coordinated the <a href="code">source
  code</a> development. He later passed the hat over to Jeff Goff, who
  has now tossed the job to Steve Fink. The runtime environment
  (codenamed "Parrot") is currently at version 0.0.10. Two miniature
  languages ("Jako" and "Cola") compile down to Parrot, along with
  several other languages in various states of completion: BASIC,
  Befunge, BrainF*ck, Forth, Ook!, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and (what has
  been defined so far of) Perl6.
