<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the recipients of the
latest round of grants for the development of Perl, the Perl modules
in the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), and Parrot.</p>

<p>Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, will receive $40,000 to work on
the design of Perl 6's object system.  Larry will also be on call to
answer questions from the Perl 5 development team. The Foundation is
indebted to Larry for his tireless work on the difficult task of
designing the language and this grant acknowledges his work in the
Perl community and on the Perl language.</p>

<p>Daniel Grunblatt will receive $2,000 to enhance Parrot's
Just-in-Time (JIT) engine to support the SGI MIPS, Intel IA-64, and HP
PA/RISC CPU architectures. Daniel will also work on improving Parrot's
JIT speed on other popular CPU architectures, including Intel ARM, HP
Alpha, IBM PowerPC, Intel x86, and Sun SPARC. Daniel's grant also
includes making significant improvements to the Parrot debugger.</p>

<p>Leopold Toetsch will receive $4,000 to redesign the file format for
compiled Parrot programs.  Leopold's work is necessary for Parrot
programs to dynamically load external modules. This grant will also
enable Parrot programs to evaluate source code generated at
runtime.</p>

<p>Pete Sergeant will receive $4,000 for work on Rich Text Format
(RTF) parsing modules, to improve Perl's ability to work with RTF, a
document format widely supported by dozens of word processors,
including Microsoft Word. The grant will allow developers to use Perl
to develop applications that use RTF by updating the core RTF modules
on CPAN; building a set of translators and applications; and the
creation of a website for Perl RTF modules and discussion.</p>

<p>Autrijus Tang will receive $2,000 for two months development to
kick start internationalization of Slash, the database-driven
application server that powers slashdot.org and use.perl.org, the most
widely used open-source Perl solution for such tasks. Slash's lack of
internationalization support has hindered its widespread adoption,
which this grant aims to rectify. Goals include implementing Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and internationalized paged templates; a Chinese
localization; and an "Interface Language" option allowing users to
select their own display language.</p>

<p>Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode
for interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although the project
aims to support other languages in the future. Parrot will be the core
of the Perl interpreter; it will be the target platform to which Perl
6 code is compiled.</p>

<p>The Perl Foundation is dedicated to the advancement of the Perl
programming language through open discussion, collaboration, design,
and code. The Perl Foundation is a unit of the Yet Another Society
(YAS), a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization based in Holland,
Michigan.</p>
