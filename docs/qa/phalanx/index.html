<H2>About Phalanx</h2>

The Phalanx project has three goals:

<OL>
    <LI>Strengthen CPAN's tests, coverage and documentation
    <LI>Strengthen Perl's tests and coverage
    <LI>Bring in newcomers to the Perl development process
</OL>

When Ponie was announced in July 2003, we knew that it would require
a regression test suite larger than Perl had ever had before.
Fortunately, with the CPAN, we have a huge selection to choose
from.  Based on the assumption that the 80/20 rule holds true for
CPAN usage, we shifted it to the 98/2 rule.  We're hoping that the
100 distributions we've selected, mostly on rough statistical
analysis of usage, will cover a huge part of the CPAN that's used
by the Perl community.

<P>

As the Phalanx project continues, we'll start looking at the modules
distributed with Perl, as well as the tests that test Perl itself.
For now, we're focusing on the modules in <A HREF="distros.html">The
Phalanx 100</A>.


<h2>What Phalanx will do</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Improve the tests and test coverage in Perl
<LI>Improve the tests, test coverage and documentation of the CPAN
</UL>

Bugs will be found.  They're out there.

<h2>Author involvement</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Want to involve the authors.  It's good for everyone.

<LI>If they refuse, that's OK.  We can go without them.

<LI>We'll find some people who Get It, do their modules, and then make
it public what we've done.
</UL>

<h2>Creating testing guidelines</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Come up with good guidelines

<LI>Test the edge cases

<LI>Work it into the core.
</UL>

<h2>Coordination</h2>

<UL>
<LI>http://qa.perl.org/phalanx/
<LI>perl-qa@perl.org
<LI>IRC meetings at #phalanx on irc.perl.org
</ul>

<h2>Unfiled</h2>

<UL>
<LI>We WILL find bugs.  They're there.

<LI>Tests will get folded into the main distribution of the module.
We'll create the patches and feed 'em back.

<LI>We'll check documentation vs. tests vs. code, too.

<LI>Need a tracking mechanism to track progress.  maybe an RT queue.

<LI>Stats are approximate: Kwalitee

<LI>Many modules may not need much help.

<LI>Proactive defense

<LI>Use Devel::Cover and gconv

<LI>How much of the perl code and C code in the core is acutally covered by the core tests?
</UL>
