  PROJECT: Promote pVoice and the use of Perl for writing Assistive Software
<p>

  AMOUNT: $4,000
<p>
  DURATION: 3 months
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
Perl may not be the language people would think of first to create
something like pVoice. By speaking at conferences and writing articles I
want to show everyone that Perl is perfectly suitable for this job.
Besides this objective, I also want to convince medical professionals
that there's an alternative for expensive proprietary software to assist
physically challenged people. Wherever I go I try to contact therapists
and parents to tell them about assistive Open Source software. Lots of
people need solutions to make their every day life easier, but their
insurance company won't pay for it, and they can't afford paying for it
themselves.
<p>
  BENEFITS:
<br>
The project will hopefully show that Perl is enough a general purpose
language to create specific niche software like pVoice. Most people
won't even think of Perl as a language to build GUI applications. pVoice
(and other software I created in the mean time) shows that Perl can be
used for more than webprogramming, system administration and data munging.
