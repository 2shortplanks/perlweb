<p>
Funding leading Perl developers and educators enables the Perl
Foundation to effectively pursue its mandate to advance the use and
understanding of Perl in the wider community.
<p>
Public presentations by grant recipients offer grass-roots Perl users
unprecedented opportunities to learn from and interact with leading
members of the Perl community, and also provide an important means for
the those users to give direct feedback to the the language
developers.
<p>
Writing articles for print and on-line media enhances that transfer of
information and adds to the learning resources available to the
community.
<p>
The grant recipients have the opportunity to focus their considerable
talents on important projects that can directly benefit tens of
thousands of Perl users around the world. This may involve improving
Perl's own code base, or developing valuable new software for general
use. Recipients have the time and the freedom-from-distraction to
study difficult problems carefully, and develop practical, efficient,
and easy-to-use solutions to them.
<p>
The grants themselves have raised the profile of the Open Source
community, prompting debate on the economics of "free" software, and
the funding models that can best support non-commercial
development. They also engender a greater sense of community pride in
and proprietorship of the Perl language, acting as a focus around
which interest, energy, and productive interaction can be built.

<h2>Direct benefits to sponsors</h2>

<strong>A Vital Perl Language:</strong>
<p>

Perl has a worldwide impact, and Perl 6 is an important new generation
of efficient, flexible Perl.  Individuals and corporations that depend 
on, have an interest in, and love Perl can contribute directly to support
the basic costs of development and support for this great programming
language.

<p>
<strong>Tax deductibility:</strong>

<p>

YAS is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization with offices in Holland,
Michigan. All donations to YAS are tax deductible for US
residents. Donations may also qualify as tax deductions by individuals
in other countries as well (check your local regulations).  Employers
may match individual donations.

<p>
<strong>Kudos:</strong>
<p>

The Open Source and Free Software movements often operate as
meritocracies, in which reputation reflects performance.  Sponsoring a
high-profile, high-achiever from within these communities is an
excellent way to gain credit and status, both directly for the
donation itself and indirectly by association with the grant
recipient.

<p>

The software community is also heavily driven by personalities, and
many members strongly identify with talented individuals.  Visible
support for such people is seen as visible support for the community,
and is a rich source of goodwill.

<p>

This funding drive and the subsequent grants will receive significant
publicity throughout the Open Source IT industry.  Historically,
donations made early in the fund-raising process are particularly
effective in garnering community recognition and approval.

<p>
<strong>Publicity:</strong>

<p>

YAS publicly acknowledges all sponsors, and provides special
recognition for large donors.

<p>

Sponsors donating US$5,000 or more have the opportunity to display
their corporate logo on the YAS website, with a link to their
home-page and a personalized note of and recognition and thanks from
YAS. For example: 
<a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/sponsors.html#majors" class="aLink">http://www.yetanother.org/damian/sponsors.html#majors</a>

<p>
Sponsors contributing US$10,000 or more may additionally set up their
own page on the YAS website (with only minor restrictions on content).

<p>
Sponsors donating US$50,000 or more are also granted the naming rights
to a particular grant. For example: "The 2002 GoodWillCorp Perl
Development Grant".

<p>
<strong>Software:</strong>
<p>

All software developed under a YAS Development grant must be released
under a publically available license that is free for redistribution
and use without discrimination against field of endeavour.  The fruits
of the work are thus immediately available for use by
sponsors. Furthermore, although sponsors are not entitled to direct
the course of software development, their ideas, suggestions, and
questions naturally receive particular attention by grant recipients.

<p>
<strong>Training:</strong>
<p>

Grant recipients travel widely as part of their grant, and provide
free public seminars on their work wherever they go. Not surprisingly,
their travel itinerary almost always includes major IT centres where
their sponsors are likely to be situated.  For example, in 2001 Dr
Conway presented seminars in locations accessible to each of his
six major sponsors.

<p>
Grant recipients also offer major sponsors special discounted rates on
corporate training.
<p>


Each grant is budgeted individually, according to the duration of the
award, the recipient's financial needs, and projected expenses
(travel, equipment, etc.) A typical amount for a 12-month grant
involving some domestic US travel would be US$80,000.

<p>

The purpose and goals of each grant are also individually negotiated
with the recipient. These may include any combination of:


<p>
<ul>
        <li>Development of specific software packages,</li>
        <li>Maintenance and enhancement of the Perl core code,</li>
        <li>Design or implementation work for the forthcoming Perl 6,</li>
        <li>Delivering keynotes, tutorials, and other presentations at national and international conferences,<li>
        <li>Speaking to local Perl and Open Source user groups,</li>

        <li>Participation in relevant on-line forums,</li>
        <li>Any other activity the committee deems beneficial to the wider                                                 Perl community.</li>
</ul>
