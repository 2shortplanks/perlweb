=head1 This Week on perl5-porters - 27 March-2 April 2006

Be the first kid on the block to have your very own pragma.

=head1 Topics of Interest

[Part of last week's summary vanished into a worm-hole
of the space-time continuum, and reappeared this week. The
missing portion is reproduced below.]

=head2 Fixing the C<Your Makefile has been rebuilt> tedium

Dave Mitchell grew tired of the fact that the tiniest change to
the perl source causes all the extensions to be rebuilt as well.
This is because they all have a dependency on F<lib/Config.pm>,
which itself is rebuilt each time C<miniperl> is rebuilt.

So Dave changed things around to so that it (and F<lib/Config_heavy.pl>)
are only updated if in fact they actually change during a rebuild.

Nicholas thought that this might break parallel makes, and that
the C<mv-if-diff> hack was removed as it  operated on a similar principle,
causing C<make> to consider that the Unicode tables were 
perpetually out of date, which caused C<Encode> to be needlessly
rebuilt many times over in a single run.

  Works on my box

=head2 Why C<sv_mortalcopy(&sv_no)>?

Nicholas Clark saw that the source code uses the idiom 

  PUSHs(sv = sv_mortalcopy(&PL_sv_no));

which dates back as far as 5.003, and wondered why the more reasonable
construct

  PUSHs(sv = sv_newmortal());

wasn't used instead. Dave Mitchell thought of a couple of reasons
why, such as the C<getpw*> returning empty scalars for unsupported
features, but in the general case it was probably quite unnecessary.
Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes realised that there was a subtle difference
between the two constructs.

This all came about because of change #27612, in which Nicholas
changed when and where C<sv_mortalcopy> was used in F<pp_sys.c>.

  Mortal peril

=head2 C<pthread_attr_setstacksize> failure

Jerry D. Hedden mentioned that he had received a couple of bug
reports concerning the new API for thread stack sizes, concerning
threads allocating a stack size of exactly 2Mb. Jerry wondered whether
this was some sort of 32/64-bit conversion failure and was otherwise
stuck as to figuring out where to go from here.

  2147483648 bytes and counting

=head2 Replacing C<S_new_HE> with C<Perl_new_body>

Jim Cromie delivered an exploratory patch to simplify C<HE> allocations
in F<hv.c>, to see what effect it would have, and asked for comments.

  Something for hash-heads
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00825.html

=head2 Arena-based allocations for C<op>s

Nicholas Clark delivered a long thoughtful analysis of Jim Cromie's
other patch that allocated ops from arenas, saying that the
complexity it adds probably outweighs the benefits.

  But there is a way forward
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00987.html

=head2 Redundant C<$Config{d_sitearch}> paths

Gisle Aas noted that if you configure perl and set C<$sitearch> to
be the same as C<$archlib> then the same directory appears twice in
the C<@INC> path, which is silly.

Gisle wanted to patch this, but wasn't sure whether he could dive
straight in, or whether it required hacking on C<metaconfig>.

To make matters worse, he found that C<SITELIB_STEM> could add
yet a third copy of the same directory to C<@INC>, and came up with
one patch to rule them all.

  One is enough
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00844.html

=head2 A working C<CLONE> for C<Tie::RefHash>

Yuval Kogman patched C<Tie::RefHash> so that it would work correctly
with threads. Rafael tidied it a bit as he put it into C<blead>.

  It works!
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00850.html

=head2 Multiple Perl version support quandary

John Peacock admitted to having been exceedingly naughty in
releases new versions of C<version> and not testing them on older
perls. Some of the code contained 5.6-isms (notably dealing with
warnings), and wondered what to do to make it work again on 5.005.

John thought that the easiest way would be to fake up an I<ersatz>
C<warnings> module, but then, he wasn't sure how to pull off
something like C<no warnings qw(redefine)>.

Nick Ing-Simmons provided a elegantly devious lightweight solution
that please John no end. Yitzchak thought of a problem that John's
final implementation might have, and provided another improvement.

  Revis(?:it)?ing compatibility
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00854.html

=head2 Do C<PERL_FLEXIBLE_EXCEPTIONS> work?

Nicholas was working (or not) with C<PERL_FLEXIBLE_EXCEPTIONS> and
came to the conclusion that due to a compilation error, it didn't
work, couldn't work, and could never have worked in over six years
and twelve stable releases of Perl. Given that no bug reports have
been received to date, Nicholas concluded that they could be scrapped
without causing any harm.

Nick Ing-Simmons cautioned about being too hasty, saying that
this mechanism was there to allow Perl to be compiled natively
by a C++ compiler, to map C's C<longjmp> to C++'s C<throw>.

So Nicholas went off and tried to compile perl with a C++
compiler (C<g++>) on Linux and FreeBSD. Everything failed, usually
due to prototypes not being sufficiently precise (mainly
C<char *> I<versus> C<const char *>. From which one may
conclude that it may be possible to compile Perl with a C++
compiler out of the box, but certainly not with a common
C++ compiler on two of the most common Unix platforms.

  Probably not
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00857.html

=head2 Making the C<IO::Socket> tests pass on Win32

Yves Orton sent in a patch to get C<IO::Socket> to run its test
suite correctly on a threaded Windows build. He had a look at
C<IO::Pipe>, but couldn't think of a sane enough approach to make
it work.

Steve Hay couldn't get it to smoke cleanly on a non-threaded
build, and Yves asked for advice on a better indicator to decide
whether or not to skip some of the tests (that deal with C<fork>ing).

Steve Hay showed how various configure-time switches can be
combined in different ways to make all sorts of threadish behaviour
in Windows. Andy Dougherty said that the right way of seeing
whether C<fork> was implemented was to look at C<$Config{d_fork}>.
And if that gave bogus results, well by golly it ought to be fixed
up so that it gave a useful result.

Yves thought that this was a marvellous idea... except that it
didn't solve the problems for all the perls out there in the
field today.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00864.html

Yves followed up with a patch that fixed just about everything,
which was applied by Steve Hay.

=head2 Perl memory management and documentation

Tom Schindl thought that the documentation was unclear on the concept of
explicitly setting lexical variables to C<undef> to release memory inside
a scope. Pointers were given to various book references, and Yitzchak
Scott-Thoennes summed up Perl's memory strategy nicely: "allocate as early
as possible and for as long as possible".

Sadahiro Tomoyuki observed that while there are techniques for
pre-extending arrays and hashes, no Perl-level technique is available
for scalars (although C<SvGROW> can be used from XS code). This could be
useful for strings that are expected to become very large. He suggested
that making C<length($string)> lvalue-able, as in

  length($str) = 700000000

to tell perl to allocate that many bytes for a scalar could be very helpful
(notwithstanding the usual provisos about characters not equal to bytes in
Unicode strings).

  Let my bytes go
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00879.html

As usual, Dave Mitchell explained what was happening behind the scenes in
a clear and concise manner.

  The algorithm
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00929.html

=head2 How should C<%^H> work with lexical pragmata

One of Robin Houston's many contribution to C<blead> last year was a
somewhat arcane improvement that concerned C<%^H> (the hints variable) 
being made available to C<eval> blocks.

Nicholas Clark used Robin's insight to help finish lexical pragmata, and
was running into conceptual difficulties over the state of contents of
C<%^H> at compile time and run time, and when to make it readable or
writable.

The fundamental problem that needs to be addressed is that the state of
the hints get compiled into the op-tree, which means that changing the
setting of a hint has no effect (hence the "read-only" nature of the
beast) once the code has been compiled.

Rafael pointed out that that was just it: C<%^H> and C<$^H> are for
affecting compilation and, as they stand, are just not useful at
run time.

Something that does have an effect at run time, F<warnings.pm> uses
its own variable, a bitfield, which is stored in the op-tree in its
own right, which is how warnings can come and go during run time.

Nicholas had a look at the definition of C<struct cop>, as that seemed
to be the logical place from which to hang hints, but then realised
that since op-trees are shared between threads there's no sane way to
make it read-write as well (since that would mean all threads would
inherit the change of hinting an any thread).

Nicholas finished up doing an extreme programming number: writing the test to
prove that lexical pragmata work. And then subsequently committed a
patch that made the test succeed.

Then Hugo admitted to being slightly confused. That's good. I was
confused all along.

  I'll give you a hint
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00887.html

  Continued in the new month
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00022.html

Rafael Garcia-Suarez played around with the pragma stuff and
came up with a user-level pragma example. David Nicol and
Nicholas played around with that, and the feedback from the
exercise resulted in a couple of other code tweaks.

(In case you're wondering, a pragma is a module with a lower
case name that can be turned on and off through the code. Two
prime examples are C<use strict>/C<no strict> and
C<use warnings>/C<no warnings>).

  Your very own pragma
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00000.html

At the same time, Rafael thought that it ought to be possible to
make encoding lexical as well, and set about trying to find out
what was still needed to get it to work. Nicholas and he thrashed
out the details.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00005.html

=head2 Combining UTF-16 output with :crlf is awkward

In a parallel universe (read: another mailing list), Jan Dubois discovered
that stacking the C<:crlf> layer on top of a Unicode layer causes "Wide character
in print" warnings to be issued. The work-around is the use the (in Jan's words)
"non-intuitive" C<:raw:encoding(UTF-16LE):crlf:utf8> layers together, to turn
off the C<PERLIO_F_UTF8> bit in the C<:crlf> layer.

Jan wondered whether it would be possible for C<PerlIOCrlf_pushed()> to
inherit the flag from the previous layer, or whether C<PerlIO_isutf8()> should
walk the layer stack in order to determine what it should do.

Nick Ing-Simmons preferred the first approach, going as far as saying that that
should actually be the default behaviour for a layer. The second solution has
the problem of a layer having to determine whether some other arbitrary layer
affects UTF-8 or not.

  Layer upon layer upon layer
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00892.html

=head2 Thread non-safety in C<sv_setsv>

Nicholas was rather distressed to discover a problem with C<sv_setsv_flags>
may put an end to a workable copy-on-write scheme in threaded builds.
This came about from looking at the hints implementation, and the fact
that threads share op-trees.

  Nice ASCII art, Nick

=head1 Patches of Interest

=head2 C<Devel::DProf> C<const>ing

Andy Lester had a look at C<Devel::DProf> to see about the bugs
Jarkko Hietaniemi raised a while back. He wasn't able to fix
anything yet, but did clean the code up somewhat, and added some
lovely C<const>s in the process.

  It's better than nothing
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00828.html

=head2 Poisoning memory

Following on from John Malmberg's plea to have allocated and
deallocated memory filled with garbage values (and thus poisoned,
to cause errant dereferences to be noticed earlier, Jarkko added
a patch	to do just that.

Now allocations can be initialised with C<0xAB> (also known as
I<strawberry cyanide>) and freed memory can be overwritten with
C<0xEF> (or I<blueberry lithium>). Andy wondered how we'd gone
for so long without it.

  Two exciting new flavours!
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00829.html

=head2 VMS pool corruption fix for C<_NLA0:>

In turn, John delivered a patch to make C<stat> work correctly
on C<NLA0:>, which is very important if you're doing VMS work.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00839.html

=head2 Long file path support for VMS

Having finished with the preliminaries, John then got down to business
with a patch to long path support to all versions of and platforms of
OpeVMS that support them.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00849.html

And rejigged the C<stat> structure used when C<largefile> support was
enabled.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01016.html

=head2 Tidying up F<regexec.c>

Andy Lester set his sight on F<regexec.c>, now that Dave has finished
with it, and zapped numerous unused macros, inlined a couple of small
static functions and sprinkled the magic wand of C<const>ness over
the lot.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00938.html

=head2 Random accumulated patches from Andy

Andy then shipped out all his patches that been piling up: consting and
C<NULL> tweaks (C<NULL> instead of 0 when dealing with pointers, and
removing casts on C<NULL> assignments).

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01017.html

and redid the C<PERL_UNUSED_DECL> macro, eliminating a grumpy comment at
the same time. [News flash: this was eventually reverted, as there is
code Out There which relied on the previous behaviour].

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01018.html

and removed some unnecessary pointer checks

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00013.html

and found some more appropriate versions of the C<SvREFCNT_inc> macro
to use.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00017.html

=head2 Add C<V.pm> to the core

Abe Timmerman posted a patch to add F<V.pm>, which was originally written
back in 2002 in answer to a question from Tels. John Peacock thought that
C<Module::Info> would be more useful.

  "Why?" said Profane. "Why not?" said Stencil.

=head1 New and old bugs from RT

=head2 C<$qr = qr/^a$/m; $x =~ $qr> fails (#3038)

Nicholas Clark beat everyone else in closing out this bug from 2004.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00814.html

He also fixed up the "hash assignment to a tied hash erroneously stores data
in the real hash too (#36267)" bug too.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01013.html

=head2 no C<sendmsg>/C<recvmsg> support (#38808)

Nicholas noted that neither the core, nor the C<Socket> module provide
the C<sendmsg> and C<recvmsg> functions. Gise Aas thought that C<POSIX>
would be a suitable place in which to have them.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00880.html

=head2 Bad return value from a block with variable localization (#38809)

Vincent Pit filed a bug that showed some code using C<if(@_)>, C<do> and
C<return> picking up Cundef> in an unexpected manner.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00898.html

=head2 Encoding error in UTF-8 locales (#38812)

Vincent Lefevre posted an encoding bug. Nicholas stripped down the
example code and highlighted the error. He wasn't sure whether it was
a problem of the documentation not being sufficiently clear, or the
core for not dealing with the issue adequately

  Maybe a bit of both
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00975.html

=head2 C<local $h{$unicode}> doesn't work (#38815)

Nicholas Clark noticed that C<local $a{"\x{100}"} = 1> doesn't behave
correctly (the way a non-Unicode key like C<local $a{"N"} = 1> does),
and promised to come up with a way to fix it, and did.

  All part of a day's work
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00997.html

=head2 Segment fault when using C<Sockets> (#38817)

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01020.html

=head2 C<"use sort 'stable'"> sorts backwards with perl5.9.3 (#38831)

Stefan Lidman discovered that stable sorting in C<blead> sorts
descending instead of ascending by default. Rafael and Robin Houston
had it sorted out in a jiffy.

  I hope they added a test case
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00046.html

=head2 What Steve Peters did this week

After Dave Mitchell landed his impressive iterative pattern
match patch, Steve equally impressively trawled RT to resolve,
like, a jazillion bugs, each resulting in a new message to the list.

An interesting case of seeing how different people explain in
their own words what is in fact the same thing.

=head1 In Brief

Alan Burlison forwarded a message about a new project that had been
formed to deal with B<programming language vulnerabilities>.

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00909.html

Hugo van der Sanden added a brief documentation patch to clarify the
fact that you cannot use C<times()> to obtain B<the elapsed time
consumed by running child processes>, only for finished processes that
have been C<wait>ed upon.

http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00931.html

David Nicol proposed a C<Tie::MaskedArray> technique for B<avoiding
the remotely tied global localized with a sigil exploit>. I'm a little
hazy on the details of this particular exploit. David's techique proposes to
replace C<local>, more slowly, but also more safely.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00994.html

John L. Allen forwarded the B<current, best patch for C<pow()>> on AIX.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01002.html

Jim Cromie updated the documentation to make it more clear what
happens when one does something like B<C<Configure -des -DNoSuchConfigureFlag>>.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00841.html

Robin Barker found a bug in C<Readonly> in 5.8.8 and so fixed the
bug, and added a test to F<t/op/tie.t> to make sure the problem
doesn't return.

  (I think I'm beginning to see a pattern here)
  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg00980.html

Paul Marquess provided  B<a small patch to the zip test harness for
C<IO::Compress::Zip>>.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-03/msg01021.html

Sadahiro Tomoyuki looked at some of B<the recent changes> to the
source and found B<some unmatching of parameters and types>.
Nicholas updated F<embed.fnc> to take that into account.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00007.html

Andy had a go at B<linting the source> with Sun Studio's lint,
and found lots of things that need to be looked at, and wondered
whether there were any other lint-like tools freely available that
could be applied. Jarkko mentioned FlexeLint (a.k.a Gimpel Lint),
which is very nice, but not free.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00014.html

Yves Orton found B<a tainting oddity> that should possibly be
documented. Yitzchak thought that some patches that remove the
surprising behaviour would also be well received.

  http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2006-04/msg00047.html

H.Merijn Brand B<backported> all of recent changes made by Nicholas in
C<blead>'s F<Configure> to that of C<maint>. At the end of the week
he was still busy filling in gaps in F<Porting/Glossary>.

If you want a bookmarklet approach to viewing bugs and change reports,
