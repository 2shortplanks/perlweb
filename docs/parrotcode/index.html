<h2> Parrot 0.2.3 "Geeksunite" Released! </h2>

<p>
On July 3rd, 2005, Parrot pumpking Leo T&ouml;tsch released Parrot 0.2.3.
See the <a href="news/2005/Parrot-0.2.3.html">Parrot
0.2.3 release announcement</a> for more details or <a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/L/LT/LTOETSCH/parrot-0.2.3.tar.gz">download
Parrot 0.2.3</a> from the CPAN. 
</p>

<h2> What is Parrot? </h2>

<p> Parrot is a virtual machine designed to execute bytecode for interpreted
languages efficiently. Parrot will be the target for the Perl 6 compiler.
There is already a partial Perl 6 compiler as well as compilers in various
stages of completion for a wide range of other languages.  </p>

<h2>Where Are We?</h2>

<p> The Parrot source code was first released to the world on Monday 10th of
September 2001. Since then, an army of developers has been furiously hacking
away on it. Currently you can compile Parrot assembly and PIR (an intermediate
language) to Parrot bytecode and execute it. Objects, threads, garbage
collection, a JIT compiler, namespaces, subroutines, a range of basic types
(e.g., arrays, hashes, BigInt), NCI (for calling into native libraries)
and multi-method dispatch for vtable methods are all available.  </p>

<p> Sean O'Rourke has contributed a working Perl 6 parser and compiler for a
significant subset of the Perl 6 definition that currently exists.  The
languages directory of the distribution contains other compilers for you to
look at.  </p>

<p> To keep up to date on the latest developments, check out <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/list-summaries/">This week on Perl 6</a> by
Matt Fowles, which covers the Parrot and Perl 6 mailing lists.  </p>

<h2>How to get the code</h2>

<p> Periodic releases will appear on CPAN; the current release is <a
href="ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/L/LT/LTOETSCH/parrot-0.2.3.tar.gz">Parrot
version 0.2.3</a>.  </p>

<p> For the very latest version of Parrot, <a href="source.html">check
out the source from Subversion</a>. There is anonymous access to all, and commit
access to those who have taken responsibility for various areas of the code or
produced a large number of high-quality patches.  </p>

<p> Tri-daily automatic <a href="http://svn.perl.org/snapshots/parrot/">Parrot
snapshots</a> are also available.  </p>

<p> For automatic <a href="http://qa.perl.org/">smoke testing</a> you can use
rsync to synchronize a directory with a checked-out copy of the latest CVS
tree.</p>

<tt>rsync -av --delete cvs.perl.org::parrot-HEAD parrot</tt>

<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>

<p>
    Parrot development takes place on the perl6-internals mailing list.
    If you follow this list, you'll be able to get an idea
    of what sort of things are needed.

    archive</a>.  </p>

<p> There is documentation in the <code>docs</code> subdirectory of the Parrot
source, with an snapshot here of <a href="docs/">cvs-latest
documentation</a>.</p>

<p> There is a <a href="todo.html">list of TODO items</a>.</p>

<p> Patches of all natures are welcome. See the <a href="patchfaq.html">patch
FAQ</a> for details.  </p>
