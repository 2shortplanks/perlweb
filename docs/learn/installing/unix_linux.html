<h3>
    A good setup for Perl on Unix/Linux based systems is as follows.
</h3>

<ul class="instructions">
    <li>
        Install a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>, such as
        gcc through your system package management (e.g. XXX, YYY).
    </li>
    <li>Open a <em>Terminal</em> 
    and copy &amp; paste the following command below
        into it (then press the 'return' key).
    </li>
    <li>
        [% WRAPPER code_snippet %]curl -L http://xrl.us/installperlnix | bash[% END %]
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Explanation of this setup
</h3>
<ul class="instructions">
    <li>To build and install Perl and many of the thousands of useful
        <a href="/modules/">Perl modules</a> you need to have a <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>.
    </li>
    <li>To interact with the command line and run Perl commands, a terminal
    application is needed. OSX comes with Terminal.app by default, there are
    <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net">alternatives</a> available as well.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="http://www.perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> website lists many
    of it's advantages. We recommend it here because it separates your
    installation from the system Perl, this makes upgrading your OS less likely
    to cause issues with your own Perl setup. It also means you can use a newer
    Perl than the default one which comes with your OS.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://www.perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a> does let you have
        multiple versions of Perl installed (very useful for testing if you
        want to upgrade to a new version), for the purposes of learning Perl
        you will only need one version which is why we 'switch' to use this as
        the default.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/App-cpanminus/">App-cpanminus</a>
        provides the <code>cpanm</code> tool, which makes <a href=
        "/modules/installing.html">installing modules</a> very simple to do.
    </li>
</ul>
