<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the latest grant aimed at 
furthering development in Perl, Adam Kennedy will receive $3500 as a 
development grant to further his work with PPI,
a round-trip document parser for Perl source code.
PPI parses a contiguous chunk of Perl source as a document
and not as code, and is able to perfectly reassemble a parsed
Perl document back into the original file (including whitespace and
comments).</p>
