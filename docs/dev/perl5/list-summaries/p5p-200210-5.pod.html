<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (28th october / 3rd november 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (28th October / 3rd November 2002)</A></H1>
<P>This week's summary features UTF8 and locale incompatibility problems,
discovered on RedHat 8, but pertaining to UTF8 locales ; various bugs fixed ;
various bugs discovered ; the <CODE>//</CODE> operator reappearing shortly ; and a
new way to consider goto harmful.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="problems with redhat 8">Problems with RedHat 8</A></H2>
<P>Paul Marquess reported that the test suite for Compress::Zlib fails on the
newest RedHat 8.0. This problem is due to a string holding binary data
which, once written to a file, gets apparently corrupted.</P>
<P>Gurusamy Sarathy pointed out that marking the output filehandle with
<CODE>binmode()</CODE> solves the problem. In fact, RedHat 8's default configuration
apparently use UTF-8 locales, which are recognized by perl 5.8.0. Gurusamy
quoted the appropriate paragraph from the perldelta manpage for perl 5.8.0 :</P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>
Note for code authors: if you want to enable your users to use UTF-8 as
their default encoding but in your code still have eight-bit I/O streams
(such as images or zip files), you need to explicitly <CODE>open()</CODE> or <CODE>binmode()</CODE>
with <CODE>:bytes</CODE> (see perlfunc/open and perlfunc/binmode), or you can just
use <CODE>binmode(FH)</CODE> (nice for pre-5.8.0 backward compatibility).
<P></P></DL>
<P>Tom Horsley added that there are probably additional bugs in RedHat 8.0
Unicode handling, judging from mysterious coredumps from system libraries.</P>
<P>Finally, Jarkko Hietaniemi proposed a patch to fix UTF-8 enabling via
locales. The LANGUAGE environment variable should not be used (as it is in
5.8.0) to enable UTF-8.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="autoload subroutines from undefined stashes">AUTOLOAD subroutines from undefined stashes</A></H2>
<P>Jan Dubois reported a bug on AUTOLOADed subroutines (bug #18113, also
reported previously as #17967) : AUTOLOAD is not called on packages that
haven't been encountered by perl before. This used to work with perl
5.6.1, but is broken with perl 5.8.0. Gurusamy Sarathy provided a fix.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="goto considered harmful in __die__ handlers">goto considered harmful in __DIE__ handlers</A></H2>
<P>Peter Scott reported an interesting behavior : when using a magical
<CODE>goto</CODE> to exit from a __DIE__ handler, one could generate an infinite
loop :</P>
<PRE>
    $SIG{__DIE__} = sub { goto &amp;foo };
    sub foo { print &quot;foo\n&quot;; die &quot;rethrow&quot; }
    die &quot;throw&quot;;</PRE>
<P>Whether it's actually a bug is open to discussion.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="b::* adjustments">B::* adjustments</A></H2>
<P>Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes remarked that B::Concise doesn't handle well the
new <CODE>//</CODE> and <CODE>//=</CODE> operators (bug #18175). Stephen McCamant sent a fix,
but a similar problem on other B:: modules (at least B::Terse) should be
fixed as well.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="tied hashes in boolean context">Tied hashes in boolean context</A></H2>
<P>Bug #18186 was already reported as #17718 : one can't test the emptyness
of a tied hash by using it in scalar context. Yitzchak points out that
it's difficult to fix, and explains why. Mark-Jason Dominus proposed an
alternative solution (a HASHSIZE method), which was already suggested a
while back by Rick Delaney, and rejected at this time.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Autrijus Tang reported that uc(), <CODE>lc()</CODE> and <CODE>ucfirst()</CODE> don't appear to work
correctly on the right side of <CODE>s///e</CODE> expressions, applied on UTF-8
strings. Strangely, this bug (#18107) doesn't affect lcfirst().</P>
<P>Mark Pease found a problem on offset calculations in regular expressions
(bug #18154) and offered a patch.</P>
<P>Nicholas Clark proposed to replace the current implementation of the
makefile target <CODE>regen_headers</CODE> by a perl script, which he provided.</P>
<P>Rafael Garcia-Suarez asked why DESTROY is called in scalar context (and
proposed a patch to have it called in void context), and faced Warnock's
dilemma.</P>
<P>Abhijit Menon-Sen and Slaven Rezic fixed a problem with the <CODE>..</CODE>
operator, that didn't handle well some cases where the operands were
strings (<CODE>&quot;-4&quot;..&quot;0&quot;</CODE> and <CODE>&quot;-4\n&quot;..&quot;0\n&quot;</CODE>). (bugs #18114 and #18165.)</P>
