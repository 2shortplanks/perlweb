<H1>Authentication</H1>

<p>Authentication for <tt>svn.perl.org</tt> is managed through <A
HREF="https://auth.perl.org/">auth.perl.org</A>.  Access to
<tt>auth.perl.org</tt> is controlled through <A
HREF="https://www.bitcard.org/">Bitcard</A>.  Confused yet?
</p>

<p>It works like this: You create a Bitcard account, username and
password, which you then use to log into <tt>auth.perl.org</tt>.  Once
there, you set a new password for use in Subversion.  This password
shouldn't be the same as you use for Bitcard.</p>

<p>What does this have to do with your CPAN/PAUSE id?  Absolutely
nothing.  End of story.</p>

<p>Please use SSL (i.e. <tt>https://svn.perl.org/</tt>) when comitting
(or performing any other operation that requires authentication.)
Right now, we still allow authentication over the non-SSL side, but
this will be changing eventually.  You don't want your password to go
over the net in cleartext anyway.</p>

<H1>Access</H1>

If you require write access to a repository, the owner of that
repository (and or sub-repository) must send your
Bitcard/auth.perl.org username to <tt>svn at perl.org</tt> (with the
appropriate details about what directories access should be granted
to.).  If you are not the owner, please do not request access, go talk
to the owner.  Do <b>not</b> send a password via email.
