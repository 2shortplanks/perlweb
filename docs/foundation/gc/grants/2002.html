<p>
Damian Conway received a TPF grant in 2002, which was continued from
2001, due to his unflagging energy and enthusiasm for Perl 6. For
eighteen months he brought enthusiasm to Perl Mongers and Perl
Conferences around the globe. His Exegeses have made the Apocalypses
accessible to a wider range of Perl users and his extensive background
in computer languages has proven invaluable in the design of Perl 6.
He is a delightful, skilled speaker who never fails to impress and
instruct. We are gratified Dr. Conway accepted the grant and the
amazing volume of work and travel he has done with the funding. The
Foundation also thanks those hundred of members of the Perl Community
whose support and donations made funding Damian for 18 months a
reality. We are also grateful to his wife, Linda, for bearing with his
long absences travelling.

Dan has been a member of the Perl Community for a number of years
primarily doing work on the VMS port of Perl. He is currently the
internals designer for Parrot, the interpreter engine for Perl 6. We
think he dreams in VAX assembler. The work on Parrot has progressed
with the aid of the grant since Dan had more time to devote to the
project. We are excited to have been able to offer this opportunity
and hope we will be able to continue aiding the development of the
Parrot engine in the future.

<h3><a href="http://www.wall.org/">Larry Wall</a></h3>

<p>
Larry Wall is the creator of Perl. He has also authored several other
popular free programs available for Unix, including the <i>rn</i>
newsreader and the ubiquitous <i>patch</i> program. By training Larry
is a linguist who has a fondness for Hobbits. Larry is the keystone of
the Perl 6 design team and funding his work writing the design
documents (or as he whimsically refers to them: the "Apocalypses") has
permitted development to advance swiftly. We will continue to
facilitate the Perl 6 design and development as funding allows. The
Foundation is indebted to Larry for his tireless work on the difficult
task of designing the language, and to the many contributors who have
supported this effort with RFCs, feedback and contributions to TPF.
