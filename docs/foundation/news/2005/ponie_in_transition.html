<p>
Ponie is the project name for Perl 5.12, a bridge between Perl 5 and
Perl 6.  Ponie will bring Perl 5 to Parrot, the virtual machine at the
heart of Perl 6.  A project of this size and complexity takes plenty
of talent, and plenty of support, to complete.  The first phase of the
project has come to an end, and a new one is beginning.
</p>


<p>
In July of 2003, as Ponie was announced,
<a href="http://www.fotango.com/">Fotango</a>
generously committed two years to the Ponie project. Fotango has delivered
that and more, donating the time and considerable talent of Artur
Bergman and, more recently, Nicholas Clark, to the effort.  Because of
their work, Ponie has a solid foundation as the project moves forward.
The Perl Foundation is grateful for their support.
</p>

<p>
But Ponie is a huge, complex project, and there's a lot left to do. With
Fotango wrapping up its commitment, and Nick already extremely busy
serving as pumpking for Perl 5.8, there's simply not enough time for
him to devote to Ponie.  That means we need new people to step forward
and contribute to the project.
</p>

<p>
Jesse Vincent, project manager for Perl 6, and Nick have put out a call
for a new pumpking.  The Ponie pumpking needs to manage the route we
take to get the Ponie source code from where it is now to its eventual
goal: a Perl 5 runtime fully integrated with the Parrot virtual machine.
For details about their search for the leader for the next phase of
Ponie development, see their full
