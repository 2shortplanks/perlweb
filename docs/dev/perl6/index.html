<p>Perl6 is the next version of the Perl programming
language.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project attempts to address the interpreter,
the language, and the culture.&nbsp; The internals of the version 5 interpreter
are so tangled that they hinder maintenance, thwart some new feature efforts,
and scare off potential internals hackers.&nbsp; The language as of version
5 has some misfeatures that are a hassle to ongoing maintenance of the
interpreter and of programs written in Perl.&nbsp; And finally, the entire
Perl community is invited to participate in the design and implementation
of perl6.

Perl 6 Essentials is the first book that offers a peek  
into the development of the new Perl language while it's still in flux.  
Written by members of the Perl 6 core development team, the book covers the  
development not only of Perl 6 syntax but also Parrot, the  
language-independent interpreter developed as part of the Perl 6 design  
strategy. This book is essential reading for anyone committed to the Perl  
community. It will satisfy their curiosity and show how changes in the  
language will make it more powerful and easier to use.

<p><br>The vision for perl6 is more than simply a rewrite of perl5.&nbsp;
By separating the parsing from the compilation and the runtime, we're opening
the doors for multiple languages to cooperate.&nbsp; You'll be able to
write your program in perl6, or perl5, or any other language that there's
a parser written for.&nbsp; Interchangable runtime engines let you
interpret your bytecode or convert it to something else (e.g., Java, C,
or even back to Perl).

<p>
The perl6 runtime is called <B>Parrot</B>, and is available at
<a href="http://www.parrotcode.org">www.parrotcode.org</a>. Parrot currently has
three compilers targeted to it. The Jako and Cola languages are respectively
C and Java look-alikes, with limited functionality.
