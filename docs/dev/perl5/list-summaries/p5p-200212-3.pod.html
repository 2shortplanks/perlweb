<P>
<H1><A NAME="this week on perl5porters (1622 december 2002)">This Week on perl5-porters (16-22 December 2002)</A></H1>
<P>This week, in spite of the approaching holidays, the Perl 5 porters
mailing list wasn't completely silent. Read about version objects, various
warnings, operator precedence design, and a birthday.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="version object updates">Version object updates</A></H2>
<P>The (apparently) never-tired John Peacock pulled another improvement of
his version object patches, that should now, as he says, satisfy everyone.
Basically we have now (in version.pm v0.25, found on CPAN)</P>
<PRE>
    version-&gt;new(1.10)   &lt; version-&gt;new(1.2)   # 1.100 &lt; 1.200
    version-&gt;new(&quot;1.10&quot;) &gt; version-&gt;new(&quot;1.2&quot;) # 1.010 &gt; 1.002</PRE>
<P>The integration of this into bleadperl will wait until next year, if a
full consensus is reached -- see the thread for the porters' comments.</P>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="new warning discussed">New warning discussed</A></H2>
<P>Benjamin Goldberg proposed to introduce a new warning, aimed at warning
programmers against using a <CODE>$DIGIT</CODE> variable when the previous regular
expression didn't match, as in :</P>
<PRE>
    $str =~ /(something)/; print $1;</PRE>
<P>In fact he proposes the warning to be triggerred whenever a regular
expression match is used in void context. Among the points discussed were:
should this be a run-time or a compile-time warning ? Should it be limited
to failing matches ? Should it warn when the <CODE>$DIGIT</CODE> variables aren't
used ? What about regular expression with side-effects ?</P>

<H2><A NAME="a bit of language design">A bit of language design</A></H2>
<P>Larry Wall commented about the recently modified parsing of the <CODE>? :</CODE>
ternary operator, proposed by Stephen McCamant one month ago. Current
perls reject <CODE>$cond ? $a and $b : $c;</CODE> as a syntax error, and Stephen
provided a patch to accept this. However, Larry notes that with this
patch,</P>
<PRE>
    $cond ? $a and $b : $c and $d;</PRE>
<P>would be equivalent to</P>
<PRE>
    ($cond ? $a and $b : $c) and $d;</PRE>
<P>which doesn't look like the Right Thing.</P>

<H2><A NAME="perl birthday present">Perl birthday present</A></H2>
<P>Perl is 15 years old ! To commemorate this event, perl 1.0.15, the
latest maintenance release of Perl 1, was released by Michael G Schwern.</P>
<PRE>
    <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021218235532.GA852%40blackrider.schwern.org">http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20021218235532.GA852%40blackrider.schwern.org</A></PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="in brief">In brief</A></H2>
<P>Michael also released an alpha version (6.06_01) of MakeMaker, and asked
for testers, notably on non-Unix platforms, and for complex modules.
Some problems were reported on Windows.</P>
<P>Jos Boumans remarks that on Windows, both <CODE>'Foo/Bar.pm'</CODE> and
<CODE>'Foo\\Bar.pm'</CODE> could be set as keys in the %INC hash. This behavior
could cause problems, notably with IPC::Run. (Bug #19213)</P>
<P>Steve Noynaert reported a couple of strange build problems on AIX, one of
them involving breakage of the <CODE>glob()</CODE> function. Nicholas Clark suggested
that his system (libraries and/or compiler versions) could be blamed for
this.</P>
<P>H. Merijn Brand suggested that <CODE>perl -v</CODE> should report the patchlevel on
developement build (as <CODE>perl -V</CODE> does).</P>
<P>Dave Mitchell continues to patch the lexical engine, first by proposing to
remove the useless SvPADBUSY flag, then by introducing a new flag
SvPADSTALE, <EM>set on a lexical in a pad which has gone out of scope</EM>.</P>
<P>Paul Marquess asked for a good generic way to catch C++ exceptions in XSUB
code and to pass them back to Perl code.</P>
<P>Jeff Sumler notes that the infamous warning <EM>Use of uninitialized value</EM>
would be better written <EM>Use of undefined value</EM>, as one could initialize
a value to <CODE>undef</CODE> on purpose.</P>
<P>Clinton Pierce reported bug #18917, about <CODE>system()</CODE> executing external
commands twice on Win32 in some cases, when its exit status is non null.</P>
<P>
