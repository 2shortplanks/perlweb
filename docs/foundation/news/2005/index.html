<h2>December 5, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/blog_announced.html">Announcing the Perl Foundation Blog</a></h2>
<p>
The Perl Foundation was established in December 2001, but is a mystery
to many people.  Today we announce
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation Blog</a> at
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">blog.perlfoundation.org</a>
(also available as
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/atom.xml">Atom</a>
and
<a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/index.xml">RSS</a>).
</p>

<p>
Perl Foundation News is the place to read updates on what members of the
Foundation's working groups are working on and for other project-related
announcements.  Where before a working group member might post an update
to his
<a href="http://use.perl.org/">use.perl</a>
journal, or a meditation on
<a href="http://perlmonks.org">perlmonks.org</a>,
from today those updates and more will be appearing on the Perl
Foundation Blog.
</p>

<p>
The Perl Foundation's work includes:
<ul>
<li>sponsoring the <a href="http://yapc.org/">YAPC</A> conferences and supporting their organizers
<li>managing <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/">grants</a> for Perl-related projects
<li>working with outside groups, as on Google's
    <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/gc/grants/2005-googlesoc.html">Summer Of Code</a> project
<li>putting a public face on the work of the Perl community
<li>providing <a href="http://noc.perl.org/">technical infrastructure</A> for web hosting and Subversion repositories
<li>supporting and coordinating volunteer efforts
</ul>
Now you can get information about these activities.
</p>

<p>
Comments are enabled, allowing you to give feedback directly to our
working group members. Talk directly to us and tell us what we're doing
right or wrong. Ask us questions and we'll do our best to answer. We
love comments and want to hear your views.
</p>

<p>
We're well aware of the problems of the past.  We know that communications
have been weak.  We're working hard for the trust of the Perl community,
and creating the Perl Foundation Blog is a crucial step as we work to
earn that trust.
</p>

<p>
Whether you want to participate in helping make the Perl community even
better, or interested in what's going on, we hope that
<a href="http://blog.perlfoundation.org/">blog.perlfoundation.org</a>
helps.

<h2>November 26, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/steering_commitee_chairman.html">Richard Dice elected Perl Foundation steering committee chair</a></h2>
<p>
Richard Dice has been elected to chair the Perl Foundation Steering
Committee.  Richard fills the vacancy left by Bill Odom when he
became TPF President.  The election was between Jim Brandt and Richard,
who have both done great work for the community, most notably organizing
YAPC::NA 2004 in Buffalo and YAPC::NA 2005 in Toronto, respectively.
</p>


<p>
Richard has clear ideas for where TPF should be headed.  Richard's draft
of a TPF mission statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
TPF exists to promote Perl to people and organizations so that they
can benefit from all of what is available within the Perl community.
</p>
<p>
Because we want to help.
</p>

<p>
If we are successful then the result will be the growth of the Perl
language and community -- a positive feedback loop to the benefit
of all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Richard sees this as fitting into four specific areas of activity:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Introduce Perl, and foster its use, to IT professionals and
amateurs of all stripes (programmers, sysadmins, students, scientists, engineers and more)

<li> Work to create a space within the IT and business world
that is amenable to the use of Perl

<li> Provide support to people working on key technological
(and sometimes cultural) pieces of Perl

<li> Lead the Perl culture -- by providing a good example
</ol>

<p>
In the coming months, watch <a href="http://perlfoundation.org/">http://perlfoundation.org</A> for more specific plans.

<h2>November 22, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/yapc_na_2006_announced.html">YAPC::NA 2006 in Chicago, June 26-28th</a></h2>
<p>
The Perl Foundation is proud to announce YAPC::NA 2006 in Chicago.
From June 26th to 28th, hundreds of Perl programmers will descend upon
the <A HREF="http://www.iit.edu">Illinois Institute of Technology</A>
for three days of conference sessions and community, including some of
the biggest names in the Perl community.
</p>

<p>
Each year, Yet Another Perl Conference offers an affordable, accessible
conference put together by grass-roots volunteers, as part of the work
done by <A HREF="http://perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</A>.
This year, a team led by Josh McAdams, publisher of the popular
<A HREF="http://perlcast.com/">Perlcast</A> podcast, and Pete Krawczyk,
are putting together another great conference.  McAdams noted, "We have
a lot of big plans for the conference and a lot of expectations to live
up to. With low costs, a central location, and a wealth of local Perl
talent, be ready for a YAPC to remember."
</p>

<p>
The official website,
<A HREF="http://www.yapcchicago.org">yapcchicago.org</A>, will have the
latest information about the plans.

<h2>November 9, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/new_parrot_grant_manager.html">New Parrot Grant Manager</a></h2>
With my stepping up to head the grant committee, I've had a number of issues I've needed to address. One of the most pressing has been finding a dedicated grant manager for the Parrot project. While I've temporarily filled this role, I have too many other pressing tasks to accomplish to be able to give this role the attention it needs. NLnet has been a huge supporter and we've needed to communicate with them on a regular basis about the Parrot development. We determined that we needed to meet the following criteria for a grant manager:

<ul>
<li>An individual who is both well-known and respected in the Perl community.
<li>Deep knowledge of Perl and has paid attention to the Parrot project.
<li>No conflict of interests (for example, this ruled out Jesse Vincent, the project manager).
<li>Was foolish, er, courageous enough to take on this challenge.
</ul>
Enter Dave Rolsky of <a href="http://masonhq.com/">Mason</a> fame. Currently an employee with <a href="http://www.socialtext.com">Socialtext</a>, Dave has agreed to handle this very important role. Primarily he will be keeping abreast of the Parrot project and communicating with NLNet to let them know what's being accomplished. Further, as the Parrot Grant Manager, he'll be the one deciding whether or not specific goals have been accomplished and money should be distributed.
<p>
Congratulations and many thanks to Dave on helping out! Viva la Parrot!
<p>
Cheers,
Ovid

<h2>October 16, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/steering_committee_elections.html">New President, Steering Committee Members Announced</a></h2>
<p>
Bill Odom has been appointed president of The Perl Foundation, and
four new members have been elected to its Steering Committee, the Perl
Foundation announced today.
</p>

<p>
Allison Randal, president since 2002, is stepping aside to take a
more active role in Perl 6 and Parrot development.  "I endorse Bill
wholeheartedly," she said.  "Bill is calm in a crisis, follows
through on what he starts, and inspires others to do great work.
I can't think of anyone better suited to lead TPF through our next
steps of growth."
</p>                                                 

<p>
Bill started working with TPF at OSCON in 2004 when he organized
the exhibit hall booth and took charge of the auction.  Soon after,
he was elected to chair the Steering Committee. 
</p>

<p>
There are also big changes in the Steering Committee that does the
day-to-day work of TPF.  Four new members have been elected.
</p>

<p>
The Grants Commmittee will be led by Curtis "Ovid" Poe, who has already
distinguished himself as a grant manager for TPF.  His experience and
dedication, most recently with the Google Summer of Code / Perl Foundation
grant recipients, has shown how valuable Curtis is to TPF.
</p>

<p>
Long-time TPF member Jim Brandt is stepping into the role of Conferences
Committee chair. He assembled and managed the incredible team that
hosted the very successful YAPC::NA in Buffalo in 2004, and has used
that experience to help others organize subsequent conferences.
</p>                                                                            

<p>
New public relations coordinator Andy Lester, while new to TPF, is no
stranger to the Perl community. He's well-known as an outspoken, steadfast
advocate of Perl, and is definitely the right person to provide "Public
Relations the Perl way" -- honest, forthright, and useful information,
as the community rightly demands.
</p>

<p>
Kirsten Jones may be a new name to many, but brings a wealth of experience
to her role as the webmaster of perlfoundation.org.  A self-described
"serial volunteer," she's lent her considerable skills and energy to a
variety of organizations over the past few years.
</p>

<p>
TPF president Bill Odom said "I'm very pleased with the results of
these elections. We're fortunate to have such capable people willing to
volunteer their time and talents for the Perl community, and I'm looking
forward to working with all of them."
</p>

<h2>August 2, 2005<br><a class="title_link" href="/news/2005/white_camel_awards.html">2005 White Camel Awards</a></h2>
<p>The Perl Foundation is proud to announce the winners of the 2005 <A
HREF="http://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel">White Camel</A>
awards.  The awards were announced today,  by David H. Adler at the <A
HREF="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/">2005 O'Reilly Open
Source Convention</A> in Portland, Oregon.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Stas Bekman</b></dt>
<dd>
Stas Bekman has been a tireless advocate for large-scale applications
in Perl and, of course, mod_perl. He went from an occasional asker of
questions on the mod_perl list to answering many questions, and had
the forethought to write it all down, creating and maintaining the
mod_perl guide which quickly grew to over 600 pages. Recently, he made
himself available for free talks to Perl Mongers groups during a trip
covering North America, Australia, the Middle East and elsewhere.

<dt><b>Eric Cholet</b></dt>
<dd>
Eric Cholet may be familiar to you as the technical manager of the
YAPC Europe Foundation and as co-author of A Conference Toolkit (ACT),
which has been used to administer several European YAPCs. More
importantly, though, he works behind the scenes at perl.org,
moderating the mailing lists we all use. If you've noticed the absence
of spam on a perl.org mailing list, filters help, but Eric catches
what falls through.
</dd>

<dt><b>Andy Lester</b></dt>
<dd>
Andy Lester is one of the prominent voices advocating testing and
quality assurance. He has written extensively on the importance of
good testing and maintains qa.perl.org. He is also the creator and
project leader of Phalanx, which is devoted to improving tests and
test coverage of Perl and CPAN modules to maintain quality as
development continues. Phalanx encourages interaction between
programmers by having groups of developers work together to improve
test coverage on the most used CPAN modules.

<p>With the close of another successful YAPC::NA, it is now
time to throw open the call for venues for next year's (2006) YAPC::NA
conference.</p>

<p>You can get details on what a YAPC venue needs at 
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt">http://www.yapc.org/venue-reqs.txt</a>. 
When making your proposal, in
addition to venue information and possible dates, do please make sure to include
details on airport locations, local public transit (as well as transit
to the venue from the airport!), local cultural attractions, and
accommodation information. (See the docs for more details) The more
information you provide, within reason, the better.</p>

<p>As with last year, we are also making available the different categories, and
weight for those categories, for prospective proposers. Please visit
<a href="http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt">http://yapc.org/yapc-crit.txt</a>
for more information on this. This shows
the catgeories under which venues will be reviewed to be able to bring
another great conference to you, at the lowest cost possible.</p>

<p>Send the proposals to yapc-venues AT yetanother DOT org. Proposals are
due by Friday, September 2 2005, with a decision due on September 16 
2005. (If the summertime vacation blahs catch everyone out we may
extend the deadline. Don't count on that) This gives about N weeks,
which should be manageable, and should still fit within most college
and university scheduling requirements.</p>

<p>This is your chance to bring a YAPC to your town. It's a very rewarding
experience, and is a great way to give to the Perl community. If you
have questions about writing a proposal, you can send them to
<a href="mailto:yapc-venues_AT_yetanother_DOT_org">yapc-venues AT yetanother
