<ul>
<li>Ajax library for Template Toolkit, akin to the Ajax support in Ruby in Rails (likely mentor: the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/06/02/catalyst.html">Catalyst</a> project).
<li>Put together a megadistro of Perl: pick guru brains to come up with the
modules they use.  Assemble a Makefile to build an install of Perl with
those modules, make sure everything passes 'make test', package the results as
RPM, .pkg, etc., and offer to the world.
<li>A visual SQL query-builder in Perl.
<li>Build a suite of tools around WxWidgets for cross-platform GUI apps with low overhead (i.e., don't require Tk or GNOME overhead).
<li>A Perl SOAP library including WSDL support.
<li>Automate smoke testing new Perl releases with CPAN (possible mentor: Adam Kennedy).
<li>Smoke testing architecture for binary compatibility between versions of Perl.
<li>Develop a strategy for useful benchmarking of the Perl core.
<li>Benchmarks for PGE (Parrot Grammar Engine) (likely mentor: Patrick Michaud)
<li> Profile Perl - measure the performance of the Perl interpreter using free
tools such as cachegrind, gprof, and dtrace, and work to reduce the bottlenecks
they reveal.
<li>Anything in the Perl 5 <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~nwclark/perl-5.8.7/pod/perltodo.pod#DESCRIPTION">TODO list</a>. 
<li>Polish up and finish off <a href="http://use.perl.org/~chromatic/journal/20481">P5NCI</a> (likely mentor: chromatic).
<li> <a href="http://llvm.cs.uiuc.edu/">LLVM</a> <-> Parrot interop (likely mentor: Leo T&ouml;tsch)
<ul>
<li> Parrot as LLVM backend (LLVM -> PASM)
<li> PIR -> LLVM (not really, but evaluate optimizations)
<li> Implement well-known optimizations in PIR compiler (SSA -> register allocation)
<li> Runtime & offline bytecode optimization
</ul>

<li>Parrot GC: generational, multi-threaded GC

<li>Parrot JIT: improve & complete JIT for some set of subsystems from alpha to
Z8000 i.e. several pieces, one per platform

<li>Parrot threads: STM (software transactional memory as in GHC, et al.) for Parrot
</ul>
