[% page.title ="Perl 6" %]

<p>Perl6 is the next version of the Perl programming
language.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project attempts to address the interpreter,
the language, and the culture.&nbsp; The internals of the version 5 interpreter
are so tangled that they hinder maintenance, thwart some new feature efforts,
and scare off potential internals hackers.&nbsp; The language as of version
5 has some misfeatures that are a hassle to ongoing maintenance of the
interpreter and of programs written in Perl.&nbsp; And finally, the entire
Perl community is invited to participate in the design and implementation
of perl6.
</p>


<p>"Perl 5 was my rewrite of Perl.&nbsp; I want Perl 6 to be the community's
rewrite of Perl and of the community."

<p><br>The vision for perl6 is more than simply a rewrite of perl5.&nbsp;
By separating the parsing from the compilation and the runtime, we're opening
the doors for multiple languages to cooperate.&nbsp; You'll be able to
write your program in perl6, or perl5, or any other language that there's
a parser written for.&nbsp; Interchangable runtime engines let you
interpret your bytecode or convert it to something else (e.g., Java, C,
or even back to Perl).

    Perl 6 Essentials is the first book that offers a peek into the
    development of the new Perl language while it's still in flux.
    Written by members of the Perl 6 core development team, the book
    covers the development not only of Perl 6 syntax but also Parrot,
    the language-independent interpreter developed as part of the Perl
    6 design strategy. This book is essential reading for anyone
    committed to the Perl community. It will satisfy their curiosity
    and show how changes in the language will make it more powerful
    and easier to use.
