it a second time.

Active TPF volunteers are not eligible to receive the award. This
includes board members, steering committee members, grants committee
members, and members of any subcommittees.

The vote of the awards committee is final. The board has veto power
over the committee's decisions, but won't use that power unless it's
absolutely necessary (which means probably never).
