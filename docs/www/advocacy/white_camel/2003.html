<dt><b>Robert Spier</b>
<dd> is one of the volunteer sysadmins for perl.org.  Working
 alongside 2001 White Camel recipient Ask Bjorn Hansen, Robert's
 unflagging efforts ensure that perl.org's mailing lists, websites,
 CVS repositories, mail archives and news servers stay up and
 running.  Robert has also taken responsibility for revamping 
 bug tracking for Perl by managing RT installations for Perl, as
 well as Parrot, CPAN modules and other ancilliary Perl projects.

<dt><b>Jarkko Hietaniemi</b>
<dd> is a longtime contributor to the Perl language and the
 Perl community.  Among his many efforts are creating CPAN, the
 Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.  In his role as CPAN's
 Self-Appointed Master Librarian (OOK!), Jarkko has managed the
 master CPAN archive since its creation in 1995.  Most Perl
 programmers cite CPAN as one of the best features of Perl;
 Jarkko's constant dedication is what makes CPAN possible.

<dt><b>Andreas Koenig</b>
<dd> is the creator and maintainer of PAUSE, the Perl Authors
Upload Server.  Since 1995, PAUSE has allowed Perl module authors
to contribute source code to CPAN and share it with the Perl
community.  Additionally, Andreas created the CPAN.pm module,
which allows Perl programmers install modules from their local
CPAN mirror with minimal effort.  Andreas' efforts have been
pivotal in making CPAN the cornerstone of Perl it is today.
