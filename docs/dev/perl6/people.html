[% page.title ="Who's Who in Perl 6, parrot, &amp; Pugs" %]


<U>Architecture Team</U>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a> is the
inventor of Perl, rn, patch, and many other wonderful things.  He
is the language designer for Perl 6.

<li><a href="http://damian.conway.org/About_us//Bio_formal.html">Damian Conway</a> is
helping Larry Wall with the design of Perl 6, providing a different
perspective from most. He also writes the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">Exegeses</a>, which explain
by example Larry's design documents (the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>).

<li><a href="http://use.perl.org/~chip/">Chip Salzenberg</a> is the
current Parrot internals designer.

<li><a href="http://www.toetsch.at/">Leopold T&ouml;tsch</a> is the patch
monster and the current Parrot pumpking.</li>

<li><a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/">chromatic</a> is the project secretary.
He is at least partially responsible for delaying Apocalypse 12 with that Roles
idea but lays no particular claim to finding odd bugs.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/allison.html">Allison Randal</a> is the
project manager. Her job is to herd cats, which might explain why she
hacks on the Perl 6 compiler.</li>

<li><a href="http://crypt.org/hv/">Hugo van der Sanden</a>, 
knows more about Perl 5 internals than any one person should, which
helps to make better decisions for Perl 6.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.luqui.org/">Luke Palmer</a> is the Perl 6 language list
monitor and co-author of the retroactive Synopses.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.frii.com/~gnat/">Nathan Torkington</a> is the project
manager emeritus.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.vogelein.com/~dan/">Dan Sugalski</a> used to be the
internals chief for Perl 6.  His job was to coordinate the design of
the parser, compiler, optimizer, and runtime engine.
