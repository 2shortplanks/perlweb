<H2> What's Parrot </H2>
<P>
    Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for 
    interpreted languages - specifically, Perl 6, although we would like
    to keep the door open for other languages in the future. As such,
    Parrot will be the core of the Perl interpreter; it will be the
    target platform to which Perl 6 code is compiled.
</P>

<H2>Where are we</H2>
<P>
    Parrot source code was released to the world on Monday 10th of September
    2001; since then, an army of developers have furiously been hacking away
    on it. Currently, we have a virtual machine to execute bytecode, an
    intermediate and an assembly language, a definition for abstract syntax
    trees, and compilers that translate these three representations to byte
    code.
</P>
<P>
    A just-in-time compiler and a garbage collector are implemented.
</P>
<P>
    There's a Perl 6 compiler being worked on, <a
    href="http://rakudo.org/">rakudo</a>, which implements variables, control
    flow statements, operators, basic multi method dispatch and basic classes
    and objects.
</P>

<H2>How to get the code</H2>
<P>
    Each month a new version is released. The current version is
    0.9.1, and can be found on 
    <A HREF="http://www.parrot.org/download">the parrot hompage</A>

</P>
<P>
    For the very latest version of Parrot, check out the source from <A
    HREF="http://svn.perl.org/parrot/trunk">SVN</A>. There is anonymous 
    access to
    all, and commit access to those who have taken responsibility for
    various areas of the code or produced a large number of high-quality
    patches.
</P>
