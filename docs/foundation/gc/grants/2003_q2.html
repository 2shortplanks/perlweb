<h3>Arthur Bergman</h3>
<p>
  PROJECT: Perl threads maturity and POE-thread extension.
<p>

  AMOUNT: $2000
<p>
  DURATION: 5 months
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
    It has been almost a year since the release of Perl threads. Bugs
    have been found and fixed and soon 5.8.1 will be released. However,
    no big project or module has used threads extensively so it is still
    hard to judge how many problems are left.
<p>
    The leading event loop / async project with the most public support
    is POE. There has been discussion ongoing for over 2 years about
    adding thread support to POE, but no-one has had the time to
    implement it all the way. Those who tried found bugs in threads
    that made it harder and thus postponed it.
<p>
    This grant will be matched by $2000 from <a
    href="http://www.dyndns.org/">DynDNS.org</a> and $1000 from Stas
    Bekman.

<p>
  BENEFITS:
<br>
    Integrating threading in POE will enhance stability in threads and
    further POE with a multithreaded, SMP-aware, event-loop environment. I
    will fix the threading issues that crop up, essentially using POE as
    a testcase and testbed for threading from the Perl interface. At the
    same time I will also help the mod_perl2 project by identifying and
    fixing thread related issues. (My belief is that the thread problems
    are similar between the two projects).
<p>
  DELIVERABLES:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>SMP aware threaded POE with speed boosts
    <li>More mature threaded mod_perl2 mpm support
    <li>More mature thread support
    <li>Possibly a PerlInterpreter.pm that opens up the threading core to
      the Perl world
</ul>

<h3>Daniel Grunblatt</h3>
<p>
  PROJECT: Extend the Parrot JIT to emit an executable
<p>
  AMOUNT: $2000
<p>
  DURATION: 5 months (starting June 1st 2003)
<p>
  DISCUSSION:

<br>
    Parrot will be able to emit an executable on linux and *BSD. It will
    generate an object file for the program and then link it with libparrot
    using the system linker.
<p>
  BENEFITS:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>A compiler will allow Parrot programs to run faster since the 
      runtime optimizations will no longer be necessary.
    <li>The Parrot bytecode of the programs will be hard to disassemble, thus
      protecting the programmer code.
    <li>The Parrot virtual machine will no longer have to be installed on the
      machine where the program runs.
</ul>
<p>
  DELIVERABLES:
<br>

<ul>
    <li>Modify the JIT and add a new subsystem to use it.
    <li>Replace the hardcoded addresses of the Parrot registers in the JITed code
      to be able to use that code in an executable.
</ul>
<p>
  BIO:
<br>
    Daniel Grunblatt is the original developer of Parrot's JIT subsystem.

<h3>Autrijus Tang</h3>
<p>
  PROJECT: Public key support for CPAN.pm, Module::Build and PAR 
<p>
  AMOUNT: $2000
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
      Since my pubkey work in CPAN::Checksum/Module::Signature/CPANPLUS
      works reasonably well, various parties have been encouraging me to
      hack it into CPAN.pm, Module::Build and PAR.
<p>
      But the guts for the first two modules are tricky to get into, and
      nobody from the PAR community has volunteered to do the latter either,
      so they have also been postponed indefinitely.  Here a grant can also
      help me to get an undisrupted period of time to concentrate.
<p>
  BENEFITS:

<ul>
    <li>Allow users to protect themselves against malicious trojans 
      on CPAN mirrors, which is a gaping hole in the current 
      distribution mechanism.

    <li>Implement a "trusted code" environment to run arbitrary
      script/module/PARs that are signed, and reject those that are not.
      (aka Java; see Penguin for an old attempt at this.)

    <li>Enable peer-to-peer distribution networks as a means to ship
      precompiled module binaries (aka PPM). This also allows other
      non-PAUSE sources (eg. FreePAN) to join the module publishing
      infrastructure. See my "<a
      href="http://use.perl.org/~autrijus/journal/10284">evil plan</a>"
      journal for an overview.

</ul>
  DELIVERABLES:
<br>
      Modifications to these modules:
<ul>
          <li>CPAN.pm
          <li>Module::Build
          <li>PAR

</ul>
<p>
  BIO:
<br>
      Autrijus has a history of valuable work with pubkeys and PAR.

<h3>Leopold T&ouml;tsch</h3>
<p>
  PROJECT: Send Leopold T&ouml;tsch to YAPC::EU

<p>
  AMOUNT: $1000
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
    YAPC::EU in Paris is a major opportunity to get in personal contact
    with other Parrot developers and coordinate future development
    goals.
<p>
  BENEFITS:
<ul>
    <li>I'd like to allow the community to participate in my thorough
      knowledge of the Parrot interpreter and the Intermediate Code
      Compiler (IMCC).
    <li>Coordination with Dan and other core Parrot developers.
    <li>To get a deeper insight into Perl 6, especially the needs for the
      Parrot interpreter and the Perl 6 interface.

</ul>
  DELIVERABLES:
<br>
    A talk about Parrot internals at the conference.
<p>
  BIO:
<br>
    In the last 9 months Leopold T&ouml;tsch has has been one of the major
    contributors to Parrot development -- or as Piers Cawley, the Perl 6 
    summarizer, has described it, "The Patch Monster". There is a history and 
    summary of his work with Parrot on his

<h3>Larry Wall</h3>
<p>
  AMOUNT: $5000
<p>
  DISCUSSION:
<br>
As the author and original creator of Perl, this grant is in appreciation of Larry's continuing contributions to the language and the community.
