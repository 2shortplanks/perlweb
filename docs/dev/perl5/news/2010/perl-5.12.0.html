This release cycle marks a change to a time-based release process.
Beginning with version 5.11.0, we make a new development release
of Perl available on the 20th of each month.  Each spring, we will
release a new stable version of Perl.  One month later, we will make a
minor update to deal with any issues discovered after the initial ".0"
release. Future releases in the stable series will follow quarterly.
In contrast to releases of Perl, maintenance releases will contain fixes
for issues discovered after the .0 release, but will not include new
features or behavior.
</p>
<p>

Notable changes in Perl 5.12 include:
<ul>
    <li>Perl now conforms much more closely to the Unicode standard. Additionally, this release includes an upgrade to version 5.2 of the standard.
    </li>
    <li>New experimental APIs allow developers to extend Perl with "pluggable" keywords and syntax.
    </li>
    <li>Perl now has a better sense of time and will be able to keep accurate time well past the "Y2038" barrier.
    </li>
    <li>New syntax allows developers to specify package version numbers directly in "package" statements
    </li>
    <li>Perl now warns the user about the use of deprecated features by default.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on extensive testing over the past 3 months, we believe that Perl
5.12.0 is ready for production deployments. However, you should never
blindly trust any software vendor. It is imperative that you test new
software before deploying it in production.
</p>
<p>
While we have worked tirelessly to ensure that Perl 5.12.0 will be a
solid platform for your software, it's possible that issues will be
found after release day. You can find a current list of known issues
